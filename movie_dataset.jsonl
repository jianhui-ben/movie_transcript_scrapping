Go away.You just made the biggestand last mistake of your life.Argh!No one likesa back-shooter, Tom.Outside, now.I apologize for my men.They can be rougharound the edges.But then again, so is the town.Perhaps you'd join mefor a drink?I'll give you the good stuff.Those were some movesyou had, downstairs.Never seen anyonefight like that.You're a wonder.How'd you get the face?\n\n\nBy trusting the wrong people.It's a taleas old as time itself.Gold is discoveredand everyone is happy.And then greedshows its ugly faceand ruins everything.Those so-calledhonest townsfolktook over the bank,which hadrepossessedtheir landfor delinquentinterest charges.Which you did legal, I'm sure.Now, my judges,every one saidwe was in the right.But they stole back the goldthey used to payfor their stakes,and this cannot stand.We're a civilized society,a land of laws.If this bunch gets their way,why then, where would we be?I'm guessingyou're going to tell me.There's an opportunityfor you here.Help me fightfor law and order.Help me--Hyah!Hyah!Whoa!We don't want no trouble.Heading to the depotfor a fresh start.Huh?Pa!No!Ma!Do it.Shoot that damn woman.Kill her!Open the gate!Argh!Argh!They killedthem both.I know it's hard.Now you've got to be brave.I told 'emthey should sneak off at night,but they didn't want to leavebehind what little they had.Now they got less.Bat Lash, you damn fool!Why you making troublewith Hex's men?Because sometimes trouble'sgot to be made, Sheriff.What do you care?You don't ranch,farm, or dig gold.You don't havea dog in this fight.And why are you mixing in this?I'm not. Just passing through.Supplies would be appreciated.Does it look likewe got extra stuff?At least give us your namebefore you ride off.They're coming again!Got a presentfor all you stubborn folk.I hope it sends you to hell.Shoot the wheels.Hyah!Oh, my God.She's an angel.That's why she's not hurt.Come to save us all.- Are you okay?- Okay?How are younot axle grease?I've had a think,and it may just be easierto kill you all.Eat lead.What the hell are you?Well, you certainly kickedthat hornet's nest in the face.Now Hex will kill us all.He was gonnado that anyway.She saved us.Saved us?We're starvingand dying of thirst here!I passed a storehouseon my way in.Plenty of supplies there.Great idea!Go ask Mr. Hexif'n you could loada wagon or two of his stuffafter blowing him up!Not a bad idea.The supplies, I mean.Need a distraction, though.On occasion,I can be distracting.My mistake was showing mercy.I took half measures.No more.You got something to say?Well, sir,that outside, was a goat rope.Oh, it sure was.And you boys thinkyou could makebetter decisions than me?That's right.I ever tell youabout this timepiece?My great grandfather carried itthrough the Revolutionary War.My grandpappy,through the War of 1812.My pa had it duringthe Mexican-American War.And I took it through the warbetween the states.Had to hide it for a yearfrom the Yankee Guardsafter I was captured at Shiloh.Uncomfortable,but still keeps the time.We don't give a damnabout your grandpappy's watch!Oh...But you very much should.You see,my family has always settledtheir disputes with this watch.Now, when the chimes stop,make your move.Been meaning to fix that.I'll load up.Need five minutes.I was wonderingwhen you'd show up.Throwing your lot inwith a bunch of thievesdoesn't matchyour code now,does it?And realizing that mistake,here you are.Looks like.Maybe we could strike a deal.But of course,you'd have to convince me.And I'm going to needboth types of convincing.You think you can handlebeing physical with me?We hijackthe train at Sweetwater,and load the nitro.We detonate itby the barricade.It'll vaporize everyone insideany minute now.Hyah!I got to say,you're real handyto have around.You trust me?Damn straight, I do.Get everyoneout of the barricade.I'm gonna end thisonce and for all.Hyah!Argh!Hurry up,let's get out of here!Are you crazy?You go out there,you'll get these kids shot.Sheriff, we've got to leave.The angel's coming back,and she's coming back angry.I'm putting in for hazard pay.Look!Since there's, uh,nothing left to fight over,you could stay.With us.Nothing's over until I say.Ahhh!Would you have stayed?Welcome to my home.Welcome to Shamballah.Ugly one, aren't you?And the prisoners?To the mines.Their sword arms will be putto work swinging picks.Until the nextmercenary arrives.We should have killed Deimoswhen we had the chance.I understand your ire, friend.But we cannot change the past,only ensure the same mistakesare not made in the future.Gather those that are able.We'll strike back,finish Deimos once and for all.Something funny, slave?Mercenary.There is a difference.Not from where I'm standing.You take an armyto the wizard's,your queen might as welllook for another king.You'll be deadbefore you see his face.And let me guess,for your freedom,you'll lead usto his throne room?No.For my freedomand a pile of gold.You give me those,I'll draw a map to his castle.Mercenary, remember?You can't possiblybe considering this.How can we trust him?We can't.That's why he's coming with us.The hell I will.You want your coin?You want your freedom?Then you'll earn itlike the rest of us.Or you can enjoythe darkness of the minesuntil you're old and gray.Is this necessary?Be grateful,it's only one chain.Machiste...For Skartaris!Mariah, scout ahead.It's high time we make camp.It's best to wait for night.Night?The darkness.You know as well as I,the sun shinesforever on Skartaris.Yes.Where did you sayyou were from, mercenary?I...It matters not.You come to kill a kingwith a mercenary horde,wearing a strange helmet,and yet you don't knowwhere you're from.I am your prisoner,not your gossiping harlot.There's a wooded glade,an arrow's shot away.Lead on.Mercenary.How long now?Across the Desert of Dreams,where men see visionsthat are more than visions.Then a short ridethrough the Dragon Sea.What can you tell usabout this wizard?His fortress?Not much.Not... Why are you here, then?I told you, I couldtake you to his castle.Beyond that,you're the onesintent on dying.You fear his magic.I don't fear much of anything.Besides, I don'tbelieve in magic.What do you believe in?Steel. Gold.The evilin the heartsof all men.Then you keep poor company.My king is a good man.Do you think so?Because he fightsfor truth and justice?No.All men are evil.He knows as well as I,the darknessthat resides in our souls.Then it is up to usto stand up to the darkness.I've seen a jesterslit the throatof his own king.Men made of icesteal from the poor,and women more cat than womanmanipulate the just.And no one could stop them.Because evilis as unstoppable as the rain.That's why we fightfor those that can't.A good man knowsthat the darknesswill always be there,but stands against it anyway.Unlike mercenary scum like you,who care only about yourself.How did you cometo be in his employ?He found me.He promised me richesif I would take your head.And you took itbecause death is nothingto a man with no life.You know nothing about me.Neither do you.What is it?To the trees!Argon and Rapasil.And you,you may have saved my life,but don't think you can escape.I'm not up here to escape.I'm waiting to seewhat those creatureswere running from.Like hell.There.Baroth Mountain.Hold.What is it?I'm not sure.To shore!Argh!The soonerthis cursed quest is over,the better.It's... It's...It's you, isn't it?Visions that are not visions.Climb!Here!Mariah.Something isn't right.What isn't rightis we're taking too long.Every second we wasteis one in which more could die.I'm going in, even ifyou're too scared.Machiste, no!It's hopeless.What good are weagainst such magic?Weren't you the one who saidgood men stood against evil,despite the odds?What is it?How did you know?I'm not sure.Run. Run!Give me the key.This is no time! Hurry!You can't.I can.You know the rulewhen running from a beast,be faster thanthe man you're with.Where is Warlord?Dead.Who are you?I don't know.There was a wreck, I think,and then Deimos found me.Enough chatter!Help us out of here.We can still kill the wizard,and save Skartaris.No.I want no part of your quest.Besides, there's no timeto save you.But there is enough timeto save myself.Ah-ah-ah.You don't want my magic wandto speak again, do you?So, you've returned.And your mission?Completed.The Warlord is dead.This was your plan all along.Of course.Attack Warlord, lose.Convince the Warlordto come herewhere I can kill him myself.I'll take my payment now.After you fulfillone small task for me.Do this last thing,and you will have your riches.Do it, coward.I can't...I won't...let you kill them.Ah-ha! Yes.Well, I'm not surprised.Oh, well, one less personI don't have to pay.I should let youkill each other.You!Time to die, wizard.My sentiments exactly.Ugh!Enough!How dare you!You pathetic mortals thinkthat I, the great Deimos,would fall so easily?I am more thanmere flesh and blood.I am magic incarnate.I am the ruler of Skartaris.I am the master of this realm.I am your death!Can you fight?Free me and find out.I know this.I've been trappedhere for years.My name is Travis Morgan,and I am the Warlord.Deimos!I will havemy revenge, Warlord.My Lord, where is Machiste?I'm sorry, Mariah.It's over now.We can return home.I could usemore warriors like you.Come back with us.No. I need...To find a way back.Yes.But to where?Home.Come with us.Morgan...No.This is my home, my people.And I am their king.I need to be hereto protect them from Deimos.Good luck.Sir?

I just do.We got one shot.Make it good.Ha-ha! Yes!What the hell is that?Kent!Thank God,you got out.Faraday?I knew you'd come.Smart kid like youput it together.It started with the UFO,and here he is...the leader,the alien head honcho.That one doesn't lookanything like the others.How do you know?Look at it!Even if it's not with them,it doesn't belong here.You have to kill it.It's the only wayto stop their invasion.And after you do,we'll put these two down.What?No! They're not aliens.The minute they touched you,you started seeing things.They infected youwith their alien powers.How else could you hitthat creature across the room?Tell me I'm wrong!Tell me!You saw those people transform.We can't trust any of them.We have to kill thembefore they kill us.You said you wantedto uphold the American way,to prove yourself.This is the time! Do it!I don't know what's going on.I don't knowwhy I've got these powers,or why I'm seeing those images.But I do know one thing.I am not going to murder peoplejust because I'm scared.That's not the American way.Oh, my God.You're one of them.No.He's changing.Everything is.It was all an illusion.Not everything.We're real.And so is Faraday.And so is this.You flattened itwith your chest.I started feeling strongeras soon as we came in here.Something about this light...- this...- Color.There was no color outside.None of us even noticed.And the alien leader,it looks like he's moreof a prisoner than we are.He's fighting it.Whatever the machine is doing.He's being tortured.Help me get him out of there.We don't haveall the facts here.-For all we know,this creature is---No.Torture is wrong.Period.You've got quitea grip there, Ms. Prince.I doubt it is \"Ms. Prince.\"I think this identityis every bit the illusionthat that evilMartian leader was.Ah, then it worked.You've come at last.Easy there, fella.Looks likeyou've beenthrough a lot.On the contrary, Clark,I've put you, all three of you,through a lot.Bruce. Diana.Yes, those are your true names.And I know you well,for I've livedinside your mindsfor months now,helping create the illusionsyou've lived.Why?Not by choice.These machines usurpedmy telepathic power,and used it to enslave youand countless others.I don't understand any of this.Where on earth are we?Not Earth,War World.An immensely ancientplanet-sized weaponthat's powered by the hateand fear of its prisoners,I have been forcedto create realities.part illusion, part technology,to wrench negative emotionsfrom the poor soulstrapped here.But you helped us.That music,drawing each of us here.Yes. After months of searching,I found a back doorin the system.I called to youthe only way I could.It took a dozen lifetimes.But you never gave up.I learned that from you,as well as courageand faith.It was time well spent.He's coming! You must hide.Find the zeta chamber.Escape while you still can.We'll bring you with us.You called us here to save you.At first, yes.I thought only of myself.Having lived in your minds, I--Good night, ladies.Oh, you three are adorable.Oh. What?- They're not dead.- No.In fact, I thinkthis one's just being born.Replacementsfor the ones I saw die.They're clones.Copies of people stolenover hundreds of yearsfrom various worlds,various realities.So, we're clones, too?No.Many of the prisonersare originals.Evidently, they producesuperior hatred and terror.You'd makea great detective,Officer Wayne.I doubt it.There's too much I don't know,like how I even knowhow to work this database,or my real name,or who's watching us.Yes, I sense that, too.It must be that creaturewho attacked us.Hmm. This looks familiar.No escape for you, chump.Looks like you're gonna getsome one-on-one quality timewith the boss man.Oh, you can say that again.He ain't gonna be too happythat all of them illusionsyou've been pumpinginto the prisoners' mindsare taking a commercial break.No fight left in you.Don't know if you evenneed these brain binders.Well, you wanted him.You got him.Eh, what's left of him.The last greenMartian in the universe...This universe.What a disappointment you are.Millennia ago,she called to me,promised me power,and I came.I killed every last Larga here.But where was the power?Oh, boy, this story again.It never gets old.Now starts the key part.We were now one.The most devastatingweapon in the universe,a planet killer.But where was the key?Spoiler alert, not here.Even without it,we are powerful, eternal...thanks to the unrelentingterror and violenceof our treasured guests,But the key,she whispered to us.It took a dozen jumpsto a dozen more realitiesbefore we foundactual living Martians.Thousands of themin dozens of universes,and still no key.Then, our faithful dog here...Mercenary. Yeah.The lastgreen Martian.You had no key.You knew of no key.You were usefulonly as a vision-caster.And now......even in that,you fail.There is but one small serviceyou have yetto render the War World.That creature saidyou hated guns.Apparently he spoke the truth.Evidently, I'm very particularabout how I dress.As I must be, too.I like it.Me, too.Clark! It's you!I don't know whyI didn't see it before.I... I'm sorry.I still don't remember.But you're just a baby.Much too young to be my Clark.There are otherdifferences, too.I see that now.Then you're startingto remember.I remember this.I remember...Superman.Other than that,just flashes of a life.I remember this room.The zeta chamber.Can you take us there?Yes.Louder......J'onn J'onzz.All of War Worldmust hear your cries.Please, don't!And knowthat there is no hopefor them, either.On your feet.It's not as goodif we can't see your face.He's gonna finish you off, now.I'm gonna let you getone good shot in.Go out in a blaze of glory.Make it count.I could have just punched him.I wanted to see if I was rightabout what those thingswere for.I was.Yes,this is how I arrived here.I was bound... with this.It's hard to believe a ropecould hold someoneas strong as you.I don't thinkit's an ordinary rope.These controlsare surprisingly intuitive.Where will it take us?Virtually anywherewe want to go.Prisoners of War World,Mongul speaks.Observe this being.He is stronger than you.He is wiser than you.Watch him die at our hands.And know, there is no hope.If we want to leave,this is the time.Understand,there's an army of warriorsbetween us and him.I'm strangely comfortablewith those odds.I'd say we'vebeen in situationslike this before.I was just gonna send you guys,and then go back and save him.So endsthe very last green Martian.Whoa, that's it?I thoughtyou were gonnasay a little more.Because you are useful to us,Lobo,we give youa measure of freedom,- but do not--- Like...we thought thisugly green Martianwould give usthe key to War Worldso we could actuallyfire the damn thinginstead of justsitting on our assfor 10,000 years.Whoa!Uh, just yankingyour chain a little.I'm all about breakingthe awkward tension.Your screamswill inspire our workersfor decades, fool.Oh, come on, boss man.I didn't mean nothing.I just thoughtwe needed to stopand smell the flowers for once.You know, slow things down.Why?Lord Mongul,there's a disturbanceon level 12, citadel ring.Anothertedious rebellion.Send an enforcement detailto all levels.Reports of a security divisionbeing overwhelmed on level ten.Close battle gatesand scrambleinsurrection units.Showing malfunctionon level eight battle gate.Malfunction?It's beentorn out of its tracks.All communicationslost on level four.Lower defensive bulkheads.- Come.- -Additional breaches on levels six and seven.Security divisionsare being overrun.Power outage on level two.Defensive bulkheadsraised by outside force.Yeah, that'd beWonder Womanor Superman.But not Batman.That would screw uphis lower back.I had you kill them.Kill them?I thought you said \"Free them.\"Oh, well, honest mistake.Could happen to anybody.But I think it's greatwe're finally talking.Treachery.I know, right?You'd think you couldtrust a paid killer,and not expecthe'd totally try to kill youand take over the mostbadass weapon in the universe.But, oh, well!Yeah!Arm yourselves.There he is.- At the foot of the leader.- On it.Kill them.You die now.Yeah! Don't take no shitfrom those Martians!You can't kill us.We are linked...War World and Mongul.We shall see.What are you doing?He's still breathing!Frag him!You owe me that Martian.I put in that back door.I freed you!And who do you thinkplanted this idea in your mind?The entire planetis coming through that door.We can't hold them offfor long.Come with us.I warned you to escapewhile you could, Wonder Woman.Start.The legendyou heard was true, Mongul.The Largas did indeedhide the keyamong the Martians.Mars, locked inan eternal civil war......knowingwe would never work together,the Largas secretlyhid half the keyin the DNAof the white Martians.The other half in the green.Neither side knew.No. War World is ours.Frag you! It's mine!Until only one Martianof either race survived.I am the last of my kind.Eventually,you would exterminatethese whites as well.And then you would know.War World is the universe'sultimate weapon.You will never wield it.J'onn, what are you doing?What must be done, Superman.I don't like the look of this.A weapon of such horrormust not be allowedto roam the multiversecausing endlessdeath and destruction.Someday, it mayfall into worse handseven than Mongul's.He set War Worldto self-destruct.J'onn, you can't.They're all prisoners...the people of Skartaris,even the clones.So I thoughtwhen I arrived.But I have spent timein their minds.War World's algorithmsimply gives themwhat they think they want,then leads them deeperinto their hatred and terror.You will fail.There is not fear or rageenough on all War Worldto do what you plan.You are right.But the richest veinremains untapped.The zeta chamber!There's no time.The three of you are needed.You will come with me. Now.A handful of liveson a single planet...that is nothingcompared to the crisisthat is to come.The absolute annihilationof everything, everywhere.Do you want subtitles for any video?-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-"}

Stop, man.Let me finish my work and leave.Then, it's between you and Manju.Look, Manju. Either you like the film or not,you have to help Arun to complete the film.Me?Yes, you only, please.You will understand my purpose later.The moment you feel disinterest on the project or the film you can exit.Say okay I say.Ah?Okay.- Okay. - Thank you.Where is my appreciation? Lights.Look straight.Smile lightly.What sir, all ready?What is this, dear?We are making an ad of bathing soap.That's why, photoshoot is happening.But, you are here as to advertise for a saree shop!Look, this is soap. Not a tooth powder packet.Go and remove these and wear a bath towel exposing the shoulders. Please.No, mother will scold me.Why?Press media will see me, madam.Oh, oh!If nobody sees, you will pose anyway, right?Mother won't say anything, right?- That... - Listen, dear. Do you know why we selected you?Besides your face, your body also looks beautiful.Or else, I would've posed, no?Go fast, wear towel and come, dear. Don't waste time.Come on. I'm giving you an entire day.Go home, think if it's the only way to save your honor or not and come tomorrow.You will get a lot of money, Say this to your mother. She will understand.Hello, Mr. Arun.She brought her honor to the press.It might not be as difficult as your filmmaking, but......these are some cases demand.No, no. This is also difficult work.Sir, don't say anything to please me.As per my boss order, I'm here with a job to do.You can speak openly.I like you very much. Okay?Awkward joke.What is your film based on?About awkwardness.I mean about women's.The title of the film is 'One Half of the Whole Sky.'If our society is a sky, the half of it is women.The title seems to be a poetry.Have you keep it so that everyone gets hooked by the title itself?No, there is a purpose of this title. The title isn't a bait for others to get hooked.I have some ideas on presentdays situation around women.- As example. We're thinkingwomen as slave... - Best of luck.Thank you.Do you believe, you can change everywomen's situation with your one film?Tying a girl in bath towel with......a soap in hand, if you believe soap will sold out, then...No.It's not my belief. It's Soap company's.- Whatever it is, I'm saying...- That's all right.What do you want me to do now?At first, let's not talk like strangers, okay? Agreed.See, I am searching for some women.Is it women or money?- Don't be like this! - Okay. Whom do you want to meet?As you are the head of the Seva trust, we are here for an interview.I didn't give any interview till today.Did anybody been here before to interview you?Hmm... many presses came here.I only said, it's not possible.Because, I am very busy you see!What are you going to say for us now?You see, I am making a documentary film on women.I feel your presence should be there.Are you doing a cinema? For that, I have to do makeup and all, is it?Yes. The makeup you do everyday for the society, that's enough.Okay, okay.Mm... wait.Come. Move the chair.I don't need it here.Place madam in the centre.Okay, ready? I'll ask questions whichyou have to answer on the mic.Don't look at camera. It doesn't look natural. You talk as usual, okay?Camera ready?Light, fan.Start.How many woman are there in your protection?Approximately, 25 women.What type of woman are you allowing?Those who did crimes.The place is for those, who failed in their lives.Alright.While you kept them alone or seperate......have you noticed any change intheir thoughts to do crime?Coffee is here, take it.No problem. Let us drink afterwards.Okay. Is there any motive for you to do the social service?What motive do you expect me to have?I have a soul desire in this.So, if your soul desirehas to be continued......many woman have to continuefailing in their lives, isn't it?How many children do you have?Two son's and two daughter's.What do they thinkabout your service?- They are proud of my service.- Is it?Will you permit your son to marry a girl from your trust?I always believe in freedomof an independent person.They should take their own decisions in life.I am very determined on that.Very convenient answer.Why? Don't you feel it or do your son's don't believe in reformation?At least, it's enough to treat womenof your house without any degration.Excuse me, a small question finally.What do you think of your job?It's not a job. It's a service.To bring prosper & justice to the society......four good hearted people...Cut it.You should've been there.Her sweat of shame on facewould've filled four buckets.From your words, Arun seems to be very mischievous.No, no.Nothing like that. But, he is a different character.From the questions he asked, I understood, he had clear ideas on it.So, you liked Arun very much?I see you frequently with him.Nothing doing. He invited me for a coffee, soon after the interview.I replied, I am going home & left the place.Why?I know, what he is going to ask next.While drinking coffee, he will ask about me.Then, without waiting for my question, he will say about himself.Unknowingly, his hand will fall on me.His foot will rub me.Why bother to these nonsense!I don't know how you can act like this?You behave like children, who putmoustache on face before sleep.It's okay. You have no faith on men.So, helping on his film is past tense from today?No, no. That will go on it's way.Helping is one thing. Rubbing is another. Isn't it?I think I am giving you a lot of trouble.No.If not this, I would've been doing something else.One minute, I am coming.Make yourself comfortable.Don't worry. You cook yourself & eat?Where are your parents?My parents are in Coimbatore.Father is a businessman.Okay, where is your family?My father is... Mother is in Paris.Father is also there in embassy.Are you living here alone?No, no. l am with my cousin.Why didn't you go to Paris?I can go, If I wish. But, I like it here.Okay, you will drink coffee, right?What else can we do here?Let's drink coffee.Are you a communist?Why?You have kept Marx book.I wish to know everything.So, I read this.Why? If I am communist, what's wrong in it?I hate the red colour.It should be your eye's problem.You will earn lot of moneyby making a film, isn't it?That's not my only aim.Having an unusual proffessionbecome a fashion nowdays.- I believe in my work.- I don't believe you.Okay. Sunday, we are going to meet Janaki.- Janaki? - Playback Singer.- Oh...- Bye.What are you thinking, buddy?Is it about any woman?No, no.When a man is alone, he willthink of a lady or his own luck.What are you thinking about?Surely, it can't be about women.Not about a lady, but about ladies.Because they always gets cheated.Hey, buddy.I don't know about liberty or equality. But, one thing.Two things should be tasted and appreciated.One is Wine.The other is Women.Be it by birth, or in habits or even in the bedroom......men & women can never be equal.Specifically in bedroom,there is no room for equality.See, it's useless arguing with you.You are a prejudiced ass.Yes, I am a Male ass.Okay, leave it. How is youryour documentary work.Then, how's Manju?Is she helping you nice?Okay.Proceeding well.Manju is innocent. She is havingsome disturbance in her mind.I think the reason behind her critical behaviour is......caused by some misery of her past.Hey, buddy. A bad bag spoilinga good subject. Don't you know?Mother went behind other men. Daughterand father tolerates her to certain extent.When the opportunity struck, the man divorce her.Then, how? How could Manju be happy?What? Whom are you talking about?All about your Manju's history. Too stinky.Why Manju didn't marry?Hey, who will marry her?It's for people with stable mind. She is unstable.Try discussing marriage with her. She will say, she has no faith in such drama.- Oh.- Hey, hey, hey...Why do you bother about it?Look. Women and Politicians belong to same category.They will go to any extent to achieve their goal.But, they don't know what their goal is.See, buddy. Be careful. Okay, forget it.Today, there is a hot film inthe film society. Interested?No, thanks. You proceed.Do this. There's a religious film playingin Kamadhenu theatre. Go & watch it.You think your youth will always be with you? Play when your are capable.Go, man.Wonderful... design! Manju, you are beautiful. Your design gets influenced by it.You know? When you first time came here for a job...I didn't see your certificates. Your body... Sorry! I see your face. It's enough for a job.Normally, I like women very much.Wheather they are children, or youth,if they look beautiful, l just love them.Sir, put the signature.Pen...?I like women when they are angry too...One thing. Don't think I have crass, cheap opinion on girls.In the world, two things youhave to handle very carefully.One is Women.The other is Culture.By the way, I met Arun now.He said, you are helping him nicely.I told him to interact with youwithout any fear or hesitation.I think the film's output will be interesting. You like it too, isn't it?I don't like it.Me too.Boring thing means the documentary,if it shows, I'll get out for a smoke.Not like that, I like documentary films, but the way they make it...- What they say? - Taking method.- I don't like the taking method.But, Mr. Arun's subject is too good,we have to congratulate him for that.Congratulate him then.Oh, Manju. Will you discusswhatever we spoke here with Arun?Should I?Nothing like that.I also felt after watchingArun's documentary......there is no safety for women in our country.If a man has willpower and money,to safeguard more than one lady......then the law should allow the man to marry more than one lady.They are talking about Monogamy & all... no, no, no!That's practically impossible. Too hard. They say it for sake.Don't think, I am talking in a sex motive.Sir, firstly, do your first marriage.He is not even worth of first marriage......and talking on polygamy, you're thinking? Okay, leave.Look, you can't fool me.I heard your comments.I care a foot for your comments.When I see someone speaking at the back of anyone, I feel hasty.Like the coward whowrites in the bathroom.If you have guts, come andtalk to me straightly.\"She walks wearing stylish saree.\"\"She wanders with dozen men.\"\"She talks freely about sex.\"These are your topic, isn't it?Whatever dress I wear,it suits me. What can I do?If you have three children and done30 abortion and can't wear anything......so, you are jealous of me?\"She is talking freely about sex.\"Am I talking to have free sex?Or, do you feel shame that I don't discuss sex with you.\"She roams with many men.\" That's my wish.If I wish, I will roam with your husband too...You are insulting me. I will go and report now to the managing director.Go with pleasure. He is always behind me only.Come. Wait for a minute.Let me finish this.What? Anger?- One minute's anger will affectentire day's happiness. - Look...I hate living in ignorance.I hate hypocrites.I don't like people put on a mask.They will talk like this. You should ignore them. I would've done that.If they will be like thatthen, I will be like this.You're going to face many difficulties.I don't care.I hate people who want honor......believing themselves above their worth.So, you are saying thatyou don't like yourself?What do you mean?Unwanted prestige, double life, double standard......believing themselves above their worth & all... suits you.Shut up.Or else, why would you sent your parents to imaginary Paris?Get away from here.Hello, Arun.Who is this?Manju. Come fast to the news centre.Manju, why do you call so late?Anything wrong?Yes. Are you coming?Arun, if I say about myself,even if the story seems bad......sometimes I think it will be the utmost truth.Arun, are you getting bored......coming here for me during midnight?No. Why are you thinking somethingand talking in some other ways?I feel so happy, you personally called & wished to talk to me.I feel scared thinking, how can I change like this?I can't say, I enjoyed my childhood as other childrens.I also had a house.There was a father......and mother. But, our house was a crushed one.Yes. A broken home.I also had some happymoments in my childhood.I still remember the thingshappened in my childhood.It was mixed with dream and reality.Thoughts which come acrossas dream. It's very sweet.But, the reality is bitter.Does every reality seems to be bitter, Arun?I also had some laugh and dance in my teenage.I liked to play hide and seek in those days.We can't see with open eyes during the game.Have you played this game, Arun?All my dreams of those days disappear when I begin to see.When my bangles broke at an unexpectedtime like that, my life too broken away.Manju.Why didn't you came to house?Yesterday, a man came with your mother......very tall and fat. Was it your father?When I saw my mom in that situation, the world around me broken into pieces.Mom, the great lady in my mind fallaway from the highest place and died.Even my friends knew about my mother.What answer I could've given to their questions?I sat alone and cried withoutgoing to house at evening.That was the last time I cried in my life.After that, whateverbad thing happens......I hide my feelings without showing it to others.From there on, she used to carry me along her, everywhere she goes.I was there like a dumb witness.My mother thought about her happiness, not about my pain.Father is not here, uncle.I know.Mother is also not here, uncle.I know that too.Are you studying?Study... study...Uncle, leave me...Uncle, leave me...Similar to a sudden attack to a person......who is standing without any weapons...At an age of mischiefs, many experienceattacked me beyond my understanding.I felt like an orphan.I thought to say everything to my dad.Should I say now? Should I say now? One day, dad discovered everything.What does a father can do to comprehend?Despite recognising my mother as a drainage, he continued living in that.Sad.Manju, have you eaten?Hey, stop there. Why are you so late?Can't you see?Oh, are you telling me, you went to temple? Or precisely to meet somebody in temple?Why are you talking like this? If anybody hears, they will laugh...Whole town is already laughing.You are trusting those waste neighbours of ours, isn't it?They are circulating lies, dear.I am saying the truth. Trust me.I promise on my Sutra. Trust me.Don't lie.Why are you beating me?Don't beat me. What are you doing?You made me ashamed.- You are worst.- Don't beat you?Hey, donkey......how can you do this whenwe have a teenage girl at home.I will kill you.Wife, Husband, Family. I lost all my respect and trust on those words.It seems to me like a slogan of political procession......which eventually gets meaningless.As I didn't like it at home, often I used to run away from there.There is a proverb, if the ghostsrule, dead bodies will eat sastras....our home was also like that.Eventhough, I was living with my parents, I grown up alone.I have the same feeling now.Sometime in everyone's presence, I felt alone.A feeling of having no connection with anything.Because, I had no friends to share anything.Why are you not saying anything?I really didn't felt anythingwhile listening to you.Having lot of experiences in one's life that even in childhood is a great thing.If I feel sad on one side,I feel jealous on another.My head is already very cold. You don't have to keep ice there with your words.Come. Let's have a hot cup of coffee.- No.- For me.Why are you not coming to temple?My skills are not working with this God......even if I speak in insulting manner, no reply.If there is no reaction, what'sthe use of talking to a stone?Nowdays, you seem to be very busy...What busy?House, then office or to roam with Arun somewhere.So, you liked this film job?No.Do you like Arun?I like the way you talk.Hey, Manju. Didn't you thoughtthat he is a different character?I don't know.But, the burdens I am taking are bought by him.So, you guys are going for shopping regularly?How foolish!I didn't mean that. I'm ableto speak with him openly.I scolded him on that dayin one mood and felt sad.I felt why did I do that?I called him directly to say,why I behaved in that manner.And, I told everything about my parents.So, you have become close with him.What do you mean?If you are not close with him, whywould you say about family matter?No no, not like that.I felt to say, so I said.Anyway, Manju. If you have afriend like him, I am also happy.Is the location okay for you?But, if they don't allow for shooting?Why are you worrying about that?You will get it.I came here already before.When?With Manju.Wrong, dear. Why so eccentric?Is she co-operating with you nicely?It is very astonishing.Why?She won't socialise with anybody steadily.Very unpredictable woman.She is in touch with youcontinuously, so I asked.What is there in it?If anybody else was there, no problem.But, she! She is very hard nut to crack.- Why do you hate women so much? - What? Hatred?If my hatred comes over women, I'll commit suicide. What is life without them? Go, man.You are saying about making documentary on women and all.I have written a poetry on women.\"Enjoy the woman.Don't experiment.\"\"Let she follow you.Don't follow her.\"'\"Search the girl.Don't search her heart.\"\"Dont get fooled by a woman.Dont get fooled for a woman.\"\"Hey, friend, Iron is not the only metal that bends...\"\"...women too bends.\"Enough, enough. I have no time to listen your poetry. Good night.Whom do you want?I want to meet Manju.l am Manju's friend.Everyone comes here & say the same.My name is Arun.Oh, you are that Arun?About me, Manju...I know, I know. You are the film director, isn't it?Why sir? Will you make only documentary films?Won't you make good films with smart heroes?Who will see your documentary film, sir?Who are you to Manju?Sister.Will it take time for her to come?It's her time to come.She doesn't think this place as home......for her, it's hotel.She will come and go by her wish.Why? Any important news?No. We have to meet one person for my film.Who's that?Playback Singer, Janaki.Janaki who sang, \"Machana Pathingala?\"I only know \"Singaravelane\" Janaki.You are taking her with you to Janaki's house?While going for an interview, if a girl is with us, it looks good.Girl? Manju? Hmm!How would you see good time having company of bad luck?Your fate.l have some work inside. Inform me once when you leave. I have to lock the door.What happened, Manju? Why are you so dull?We can't find reason for everything.It's not necessary as well.You always seem to be happy. But, today you are very silent.- That's why, I asked.- Nothing.While we are walking together,it seems you are walking alone.What are you thinking about?Your sister talked about you in a different way.What does she said? Tell me.She said to me, \"Leave my sister and go alone to Janaki's house.\"Oh, nice. Only that muchshe said. Innocent aunt.What?Are you shocked?The person whom she called as sister, now calling her as aunt.Yes, she is my aunt.Father's sister. She took pity on me......and kept me in her house.But, why she treat you like this?She feels pride on the factthat she kept me in her house.Okay, leave it.But, she is treating you like this...Arun.I am not responsible for my situation.l am forced to the situation.Okay.Don't ask about this anymore.See...- I... - Keep quiet.- l am sorry. - Please, don't spoil this evening.Taxi.There is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to crossThere is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to crossThere is no chariot in the townfor anyone to go in the chariotSomewhere, something, someoneThere is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to crossThere are fences between thebeautiful stage and wonderful musicAn unhealed wound and hundreds ofthorns are there in the swinging legsFeminity doesn't see happinessin anythingFeminity doesn't see happinessin anythingIs the girl a unburnt light?There is no waterflow in the river for the life boat to crossThere are stages everywherein the town with disguise kings.They are not real kingsThere are gardens everywherein the town with scented roseThey are not roses truly..Feminity is not elevated in the world.Feminity is not elevated in the world. Girls are useless flowersThere is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to crossThere is no chariot in the townfor anyone to go in the chariotSomewhere, something, someoneThere is no waterflow in the river for the lifeboat to crossWhat, sir? You said you have some questions to ask.Why are you trimming your eyebrow?I mean, why are you doing it artificially?If everything goes natural, who would enjoy then?In cinema, for audience enjoyment......especially, for men's enjoyment......you are putting makeup. Don't you feel like a slave?Sir, I think you have lot's of free time.So, by having these weird thoughtsyou are confusing your mind.See. In the morning, I had Heroinecharacter who fought for her virginity.In daytime, I was prostitute......and a princess in the night.There is no time to think about these, sir.Check, check.Check, check.What's your opinion onthe world of cinema?Everybody willingly watches cinema.But,There are people who havewrong idea on film actresses.When a girl stands before a camera......they think, she must've lost her virginity.I feel very hasty.Why sir?The women outside the cinema world......can pour rain with their innocence?Please forgive me for saying like this.No, carry on.It's surprising to know aboutthe tragedy of this world.It is the world of cinema......and people write stories around it.Oh, I forgot. Sundaramurthy brother, 'Kumaran arts' has......asked call sheets for tomorrow morning. Tell them it's impossible. What are you blabbering?Spit out and tell them my words.What were you saying?Oh, sorry. I was saying...In cinema world, both tragedy and comedy exists equally.There is something stuck above your eyes.Nothing, it's jigina.Again today, I'm going to act in a love scene.You also come and watch.l am sure you will enjoy it.What, Manju? While shooting, you begin to laugh infront of them in the set itself?Sorry, Arun.They talked about their love, isn't it?Love, our love is so scared and holy......I felt like vomiting.l was unble to bear that.They said what they know.Mr. ArunLove, affection, care... these words have no meaning at all. All are lies.You may not believe these......but, for that, doing this, in insulting manner...No, Arun. I am not insulting.I laughed when I saw the false side of love.l am not a person who doesn'tknow or understand love.I lost my family and it'shappiness in my childhood.Now, my mind is searching it everywhere.When I was into a deep mud hole,I met Kirupa.Kirupa was studying along with me.He had every characteristics, which a charismatic young man could have.Then, what! Love was destined, isn't it?So, it happened.When it was a massive task to even talk to a boy......I can go anywhere with him according to my wish seemed great fortune to me.I was happy thinking, what I have is something many can't afford to have.If I think of it now, it seems funny.We also rambled aroundbeaches, theatres, hotels......like lovebirds of press & cinema.I begin to think, my misery faded away. And the happiness which......I have is stable and true.Our love is holy and sacred are words we repeated regularly then, you know......like we heard in that cinema shooting.'l am not without him. He is not without me.' were regular words in our conversation.Now those things seems to be mad. But, those happiness......wound my scattered heart.Kirupa was like someone, whom we met after losing our way in a deep forest.I felt Kirupa has filled my void, which was created by my family.I was in heaven those days,while l was getting cheated.My mom has killed me for the first time.And, he killed me for the second time.Stones are getting empty. Shall I collect some and give you?You said, \"you have an importantnews to tell.\" Won't you tell me that?Actually...I had thought to say it, day before yesterday.We also met that day, no?Yes.We have met.Why didn't you said then?Father......has fixed my engagement.So, when are we having the wedding feast?Manju, don't you know aboutmy family's situation?I have two sisters at marriageable age.Manju.Bridegroom's family said, they willarrange a job for me, after marriage.What happened, Manju? Why are you not speaking?Manju.Don't think, I didn't love you.I don't know what to do in this situation.If I think about you...For Me...For Me...What is there to talk?He tried to pacify me saying other things.But, when we rambled around,he never remembered his father......mother, sisters and marriage. Did he?I feel pity, when I think about him.But, I understood, it wasn't cowardness.It is the carelessness of every youth.I only pity that bastard.In the chocolate advertisement, your designs were exquisite.It's an old one.But, you are really a genius.How do you get these type of ideas?Oh, that?Daily, I get up at 3'o clock.I drink a glass of milk......then, I run fast along the beach.I close my eyes tightly.And sing loudly near water.I get the idea immediately.Are you scared? What idea?Turn and see four foreign magazines, ideas will flourish.I thought, they are your own ideas.The skill is to hide the art of stealing.Chandran, take that cello tape.Open.Chandran, what is your age?Nineteen completed.- Do you go to temple?- Yes, I go daily.- Do you have girlfriends?- No, no. I don't have.If I ask you to sleep with me? Will you?No, you are like my sister.Like Sister?You shouldn't touch anywhere to your sister's body.Chant mantras, wash your hands and come back. Go.- Why are you degrading the relation?- You are wro... - Get out.Why are you staring at me like an eagle?Manju, don't be angry.I think you unnecessary angered on him.What Chandran did was wrong.You may leave it in ease......or you should punish him.But, you bursted out.If I could, I would've burnt him out.I would've forgiven, if Chandran alone was doing such mistakes.Every other Chandran, Indran, Kuppan, Suppan......I met, has done the same.- You are speaking generally.Damn it. Don't think l am talking in an urge.I have experience.You bloody...You know how to extract things.I never think of saying anything toanyone about me....but, you make me say it.Okay, I will say.Who? Is this Manju?How are you? Are you fine?Why are you not coming to church?When I was studying, we thought this as a playground and played.Now you've grown old?Problems increased more, father.Confusions are killing me.God will bless you.Forgive me, father.Whatever God it may be......if they want to help, can't they help us little quick?Why are you laughing?If he don't know what to do with the gathered applications......can't he keep assistants?l am sorry.My mind is very confused, father.I wander here and there to get peace......and for that reason, I am here.If I find it from a butcher'sshop or a crematorium......l am ready to be there.Manju, don't go anywhere in search of peace.It is there with you. But, to understand that, we need belief.I mean faith.You should maintain your mind peacefullybefore confusion affect you mind.- Father. - Yes my child. l am coming to you.You should turn your mind somewhereelse before confusion defeat your mind.Whether it is with God, Music or Literature, you have to do it.God will surely help you.Come, Mano. Dont you know her? It's Manju.Don't you know Mano? My son.Hello, How do you do?What is the matter?Piano has arrived at home, daddy. Here is the bill.Mano plays the piano very well.Come home. I will ask him to play. Let's hear it.Come on.Mano plays the piano really well.Piano music didn't solved my problems,but, it brought comfort to my mind.I found solace to my heart in their home.I felt, I found something,which I searched for so long.So, I used to go there frequently.To see them was my happiness.The way they pray, the silence, the environment of their home......had given me a new ray of hope.I thought it was like that.I thought no other placecan give me comfort now.Everytime......Mano should be with me, I used to think.My mind will get peace......whenever I speak and be with him.Whenever I was with him......it was always a great pleasure for me.He was like King Solomon of bible......standing beside the Queen of Sheba.As you are listening to me now......I shared my misery with him as well.These things made me closer to him.I gave up myself to him.Even when I had bitter experience of socialising with a man before...I started to get closer toMano because of my heart.I remember an old fable.Have you read it?One bird find it's prey on a boat.The bird begins to eat the prey.Suddenly, the boat starts sailing.The bird didn’t know that.While the boat was sailing over the mid sea......the bird gets it & understandsit has to fly back.It starts to fly to the shore.Even after covering a long distance, there was no shore.Being tired, it fly back to the boat itself.After few days, she tried again & went back......after being tired of flying.I have also searched for a true love like that bird.But, I become tired of searching.And, never received the true love.But...It's my bad luck that I neverreceived anything on my hands......like searching an Oasis in a desert.Arun, by losing every relationships......I was in a deep sorrow.Hey, Manju. What are you doing?Burning the candle.See the candle.

Isn't it?Hey, why? That is not needed at all.This is a case where he has to be remanded.What for, sir?For having giving some food to the young boywho was begging around?Then sir, we will see the DYSP.Okay.This thing seems to be prolonging.Sir, if you keep sending the cases that come herewhat is our credit then?Sir, you seem to be a little lenient.Whatever you say, this is our prestige issue.What prestige is there in this?There are still many more kids are on the streets.And they too are this nation's prestige too.Drink tea.As for the statethat man only saved the child.Only thing is he did not inform the police. That is simple.-As per the ordinary man-- -Local police were notified, sir.Okay.Anyway as you wanted now that child is in the juvenile home.Then let us enquire whether that man has committed any crimefor which he is punishable.Sir, we will come in power.Don't forget that.Opportunists.They had come to take advantage of the exposure the kid got on the TV.Do one thingtake two people for surety and go to that station.I will call and tell them.Thank you very much sir.When Lord Rama kept his foot on the--Devaki if you read like thisthis month will finish and the next toostill there will be balance for you to read.Careful!Leave me, leave me.

You are sitting here?I was searching for you both over there.Yes. I met the magistrate and have told him about the case.He is busy with a compromise in a stabbing case.-We will go there and stand. Come. -Here.If you want, we can put him in jail.Do you want that?When you both were playing, he stabbed isn't it?Can't you pardon him for that?-What? -Okay.Hey, now the accused has become the accuser.Never mind.Even now you both like each other, isn't it?You, purchase an ice cream for him.You have one too.Then you come here.Take it.Go and come.The judge took money from his pocket and gave them.Come, let us go in.You people sit here.The children will solve it among themselves.-Greetings. -Yes.-I had told you before. -Yes, what?An adoption case.-Yes, yes. Sit down. -Thank you.-Who is the man? -Come here.Yes, really appreciable.I understand your kindness and love.Maybe because he saved your daughter's life.But all the cases that come here are not like that.Many times, children are misused.Hence the existing rules too think in that way too.Considering your interest and loveif needed we can try for foster care or guardian ship.Okay.But when the child is kid from the survivors of a calamityisn't it better to transfer him to his own place?To find his parents too, it is a good way.They don't have any idea.They told to look in the general ward.-Come. -Come on.Walk carefully.What is the smell over here?You come here.Mother.Small boy.Oh, God! Oh, my child is gone. Oh my dear child.Oh, my child is gone.Oh, God!Oh, God! Oh, God!Oh my God, should I see such things?How did he feel like giving poison to one's own child?How is it?Without looking left or right they will buy thing in lots.Then when the people who lent the money, catch then they realize.Who are you to him?How is he now?Oh, what will happen to him?If you just leave him and go it is not enough.This is a government hospital.You must bring and give the medicines.Or else he won't get cured.The juvenile hoe people just brought him over here.Then they did not even come to look at him.Even now, after coming here he got fits three or four times.If one does not give proper medicine in timeit may affect his brain.For now, get these medicines.When your dress etc., are changed you look bright and smart.Sit down.Did you follow what, the Nurse said?Smart.I don't want that.That won't do.They are giving medicines, and injections if you have food wellonly then you will get better.Should we not get better and go home?-We have to go. -Yes, then you must have all this.Sister? Sister?Ambili, like Orange a lot isn't it?-Take. -I don't want, I don't like it.Does daughter like mother and father?Don't you like the small boy?Yes.Just as you love your mother and fatherwont he too feel like seeing his parents or not?Small boy likes his younger sister too a lot.Yes.

Let it go.Don't cry.Don't cry.-Please stand aside. -Okay.Sir! Where is the superintendent's office?-On the top, to your left. -Okay.Sir, we had sent a fax, with all the details.What you say is all correct!But all these have all become a file here.An earthquake for 30 secondsand to solve all this it will take 15 years.To help the people affected by earthquakea separate office is opened.You can go there and do the enquiry.Okay, sir.What did he say, sir?There is a separate office for thingsconnected with the earthquake.It is there these things are dealt with.You said Ambara, isn't it?It is a holy place of the Anjar Taluka.Many people lost their lives, in Anjar Taluka.That's why I didn't get the full report.The best thing then is take the boy and go thereand try to identify yourselves.Is it possible to find, isn't it?He says to take him to certain placesand see whether he can recognize?Did you understand?Understood.Have you seen this road?I have been on this road, with my parents to go the circus.This road goes to the temple.See there was where my house was.Mother!Mother!Father!Father!Father!Hey drink your milk.Give your lollipop to her.

Come with me.Look there.In this village, 13000 people were living.We got 4000 dead bodies.And their reports are also done.In that there were children, old people all were there.More than two thousand peoplewere sent to the camps, and the hospitals.Those who survived and identified were 3500.Whether the balance are dead or alive, nobody knows.What is it? What did he say?Out of the 13000 people who lived here only3500 are alive today.The balance were all either dead or missing.What happened?We came to search for parents.Where are my mother and father?-They will come. -They will come.They remember you?Sir, can I take him back?I will rear him up.You tell them that.Is it your father?Yes, it is my father.-Everyone is there. -What is your name?-Kochundappri. -They are calling you, come.Did you talk with them, about what I said before?Can you ask them for me?-What is your father's name? -Raimalahi!-Mother's name. -Mahilahi.House number?-House number? -I don't know.Where is your house?My house is near the pond.Tell them.Raimalahi, Mahilahi, Pawan, Payal.But there is no report of them.Whether they are dead or alive.No report about that.Missing. They are lost.At least this boy is alive.I will make a report about him.He is doing the work of a film operator.And he was the one who took the child and took care of him.He has daughter too.He is a very kind man.Sir, since there is no news of his parentsin this condition if we get a death certificatethen he can adopt this child.Death certificate?What nonsense are you talking?Missing means it is not that the person is dead.If that person comes back and complainthen I will lose my job.Sir, I will rear him as my own child.Sit outside. If needed I will call you.Go. Go outside.Show him to a doctor and medically check up.Okay, sir.Sir, when you asked for death certificate, he got angry?What he said was correct!Missing means not dead.

Fits.-Fits? -Yes.Most of the children will have some problem due to the earthquake.Like epilepsy, fits, phobia and so on.And some of them are very much afraid ofexplosions and loud sounds. That is all.These are the medicines he takes.Who is this?He is from, Kerala.He is the one and only guardian to take care of this boy.Oh, I see.Any chance to give this boy back to us?No, I don't think so.No chance exists.Because, in very similar way a child came here.After many months, his father came took him away.His father was in coma for many monthsin some hospital.The doctor says there is no chance of taking him back.Last week, a similar boy was taken away by his father.For about three months it seems he was in some hospital and in coma.Praise the Lordand surrender to him.Mother father, younger sister will come.Operator, tell sister that Kochundappri will come.The time of meeting is over.If no one comes to ask for himthen not as an orphanbut I will bring him up as my son.What?

I'm goingsomewhere normal, with my normal friends,to a place full of normal people.And you, of course.# Wahhhhh# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love# I really need it# Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love# Just set me free, yeah... #In case you were wondering,that was me with my father.And this is where I live -not with him, but with my mother.It's a long story. Well, not that long.He shagged the work experience girland then left us.So, just clichéd, really.Plus, it only happened two years ago,so I don't even get the luxuryof blaming my various personality defectson their divorce.Anyway, that's how I ended up here -the very definition of suburbia.Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.Maybe that's unfair, as they do saythat you never know what goes onbehind the net curtains of suburbia.Although, in my friend Jay Cartwright'scase, you can have a pretty good guess.Are you ready to have some fun, big boy?Mmm.I'm feeling sexy!Take off mask, baby, let me see you.Nah.Do you promise this'll beproperly filthy, yeah?Oh, yes, like bomb explode from in penis.Sexy like... mmm...finger up bumhole.Christ, you make me so erect.Oh, yes, you also make me erect.Now, put in card details.Oh, I'm so horny.Don't forget security number and bank.Mm! Come on, hurry up.All right, Jay's mum! Where's Jay?Oh, hello, Neil.He's at home, updating his CV.Ooh, excuse me.Hello?Ohh...It's a bit over, is that OK?Not really.- Excuse me! My prawns?- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.Cheers for that.- You don't have to thank me every time.- Oh, right. Cool.You're so fit.Simon, we need to talk.Oh, not talking!- Look, it's been great so far...- It's been amazing.Literally the best year of my life.My spots clearing up,not moving to Wales,and now you.And I'm definitely getting betterat kissing, aren't I?I think we should break up.What?We're both going away to uni soon,and it'll be too hard to keep it goinglong-distance.- It won't be fair on either of us.- I don't mind.You will mind, though. You will.I bloody won't!Plus, I'm going on holiday soon,so there's that.Why? What are you planning to doon holiday?Maybe you should just go home.I just need some space to thinkat the moment.OK, fine. So, I'll see you later, yeah?Or whenever?Mum, I'm back! When's tea?- In a minute.- It had better be delicious!Ohhh...- Ooh!- Oh, oh!Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me.Oh, yes, I like you. Oh, I like you.Get out! I'm just looking at holidays!It's just holidays!Jay, can you come downstairs, please?Your grandfather's died.Ooh, you've got a lady there,you bad boy!Has she got nice titties? Suck onthe lady's titties. Suck them, go on!It was our last ever day of school,something my new stepmum hadexperienced only four years ago herself.So the head of Sixth was going to saya few inspirational words.And if ever there was a man for the job,it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.I will forget each and every one of youalmost immediately.So, if you do find yourselfat a loose end next year,and think it might be nice to pop inand see how we're getting on,don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Societyand I'm not that bloke on BBC Twowho keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.I especially don't want to hear abouthow well you're settling down at unior how much growing up you've donein the past 12 months.At best, I am ambivalenttowards most of you,but some of you, I actively dislike,for no other reasonthan your poor personal hygieneor your irritating personalities.I hope I've made myself clearon this point.And in case any of you thinkI'm joking... I'm not.I assure youthat once my legal obligation...to look after your best interestsis removed,I can be one truly nasty fucker.Good luck with the rest of your livesand... try not to kill anyone.It reflects very badly on all of us here.Slightly more upbeatthan I was expecting.They say your school daysare the best days of your life.But the only waythat would be true for me...would be if I went straight from schoolto prison and stayed there until I died.How many times is thatshe's caught you now?Four. But this was the worst.Mask, snorkel, ham.OK, one last one for luck.Ooooh!Good. Old-school wedgie.To be admired, in a way.Squashing the balls now.Ooh! That does not tickle!Argh!Mark! What the fuckdo you think you're doing? Put him down.All right, calm down.Just saying goodbye to Bender Squad.- Have a nice life, dickheads.- Oh, grow up! God!- Are you OK, Will?- Fine! Slightly chafed arse crack,- but, no, basically fine, thanks.- Hi, Simon.OK, well, bye, then.Fucking bitch.Is she?No.Oh, God... I just really miss her.It's all right, mate. I understand.Anyone would miss those tits.- It's not that, Neil.- Is it her lovely snatch?- No.- I know it feels rough now, Si,but you just need to give it some time.I'm just worried I'll never get over her.- I can help you with that!- Can you?Yeah! From now on, every timeyou mention the Moanatronic 5000,- you get a slap in the balls.- Do you mean Carli?Ow! For fuck's sake, Jay!- You were warned.- How's that helping?!Stopped you from crying like a baby,for one.So my life is still ruined,but now my balls ache too. Thanks, JayNo, your life is just about to begin,mate!Now you've been dumped, we can all goon a mental holiday together.Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,sex, minge, fanny and tits.And booze.And sex!He's put it horrifically,but he's probably right.A holiday would definitelytake your mind off her.Plus, it's the perfect time to go.Yeah, they say the summer isthe perfect time for a summer holiday.Come on, Si, what do you say?The lads on tour!- And you.- Yes, and me! One of the lads.Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.Maybe it will help.Course it will!And, I promise you, Si,we'll go somewhereso full of fit birds,it'll be like shootingclunge in a barrel.What a lovely imageSo, that was it.We were no longer schoolboys.And to prove our independence,we were off on the holiday of a lifetimewithout our parents...after we'd made them pay for it.I know this is the first time you've everbeen away from me, but don't go crazy.When have I ever gone crazy?!That time you drank all that shandyat Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!- I was seven years old!- He was running round, his pants down,shouting, \"I've got a white slug!\"- Mum!- Oh, hello, Kevin!Looks like just Jaywe're waiting for, then.Yes, it does \"look like\" that,doesn't it? God! Sorry about her.Are you all right, Neil?Your face is a bit weird.Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister'sfake tan on, get it started, you know.Just on your face?Well... It's on my hands now too.All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.Nice to meet you.Where's Neil been hiding you, then?The church?- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?- No, no, I'm not a vicar.No, I know that. But you look likea vicar and you talk like a vicar.A bloody gay vicar, or something!Well, I'm not a vicar and I'm not gay.No, I'm saying you look gay.But you can't be, can you? Cos oldsoppy bollocks here come out your pipe.Right, I see.Well, gotta get going.Don't want you to miss that flight.Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. Love you, mwah!Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spendyour grandad's money chasing skirt,two things. One, make sure she's nota hound like the last one.And two, try to be a man when she dumpsyou for someone with a bigger cock......which is everyone!Dad!Dads are like arseholes.Everyone's got one, yes,but also, they're arseholes. Which is whythey make excellent cab drivers.Takes me back, all this -cheap flights at ungodly hours.Where is it you're headed to again?Simon never tells me anything.- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.- Can't say I've heard of it.Of course you haven't,it's a cool place to go.And it's got a Subway's.Oh, right. In my day,it was all about Spain.Me and my mates went to Magalufthis one time.Shagaluf, we called it!Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.Anything that moved.We had a system.Always left a hat on the bedroom doorwhen one of us got lucky.Was usually me.Oh, Dad, please shut up!I don't know what it is,but you'll find girls just seem tolet themselves go a bit more abroad.It's like as soon as they smellthe sun cream, they get wet.- Your mother's the same, even now.- Oh, God, just drop us here!I was learning a lotabout holidays.And not just what they didto Mrs Cooper's front bottom.I was also learningthat on a lads' holiday,it's compulsory to wear\"hilarious\" matching T-shirts.Here y'are.Nice!Right, you owe me 12 quid each.Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.Right, so I've got to pay more moneyfor a T-shirt I didn't ask forand I'm not going to wear, cos it carriesa nickname I didn't know I had?- Yes.- Great# Come on, come on, come on, come on# Got my peeps standing with meat the bar doing shots# Cos now we're so fucking plasteredwe don't know when to stop# I got my peeps standing with meand I'm having a blast# I'm feeling so fucking good right nowI want it to last# I'm at the bar and I see this chickchecking me out# From afar, yes, she wants my dickThere ain't a doubt# Now I'm in a lift, getting lipsHow dumb is this girl?# But do I care? Do I fuck!I'm on a roll! Yo! #Malia flight?Yep.Delay, seven hours.And please remove those T-shirts,or we won't allow you to board the plane.Despite Neil offering... twice,they didn't let him drive the plane.Finally, though, we'd made it on holiday,and Jay's thoughts on the beautiful isleof Crete, birthplace of Zeus,were as insightful as ever.- I'm hot.- It is well hot.- Might be too hot.- Might be.Oh!Carli! Carli!Carls!Oh.Sorry.Oi, Jay, Jay...Tidy minge, ten o'clock.Jay? Jay!Didn't you see them girls?Why don't you chirps 'em?- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.- Really? What about that netball team?Yeah, that was all right,cos that was a luxury caravan.But this coach is way too smallfor my moves.Ah, course.Right, so, the plan isget to the apartment, unpack,get some sleep,then head out fresh tomorrow.First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.Have you come on a lads' holidayby mistake?!We haven't comehalfway round the world...to look at some boring fuckingGreek ruins.Yeah, you can see that shitanywhere.We go there, drop the bags off,then go straight out and get spasticated.Simples.But I've not slept for 37 hours.Shut up and try and getsome sleep on here, then.Fine, good idea.# We love you Burnley, we do# We love you Burnley, we do# We love you Burnley, we doOh, Burnley, we love you!- # Oh, Burn-a-ley- # Oh, Burn-a-ley- # Is wonderful- # Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful... ## Can you hear the Preston sing?I can't hear a fucking thing... #When people ask me if I likefootball, I say yes. I do like football.But not Burnley.Burnley can fuck off.# Come on, Burnley!# Oh, Burn-a-ley is wonderful! #It was a tense moment.Someone was obviously staying here.Right, then, McKenzie party.This is you.Good one, fellas! Don't worry,it'll look nice when it's finished.- # Oh, Burn-a-ley!- # Oh, Burn-a-ley!# Is wonderful... #This don't look like the pictures.I still don't knowhow the dog died.I can only presume it threw itselfin the well, rather than stay here.You Willy?Yes.Your key. You have fun.But not too much fun.You shit on floor - 50 euro fine.Each time!All right, lads!- Are you stopping here?- Yes. We are.Bad luck. I've just come backfrom Afghanistan,and conditions thereare better than this shithole.I can't wait to get back to lyingin a dusty trench,being shot at by some raghead.Are you married?- No.- Don't get married.The wife booked this, but somehow,it's my fucking fault.Anyway, pop down for a beer if you fancy.I'll see youse later.Hey!You owe me 50 euros!As we entered our new home,wondering...if our human rightshad been breached,I couldn't help thinkinga shit on the floor...might havecheered the place up a bit.- Shotgun this room!- Shotgun the sofa bed!Well, where am I gonna sleep, then?!Not really my problem.What's that? Is that the bath?Course it's not the bath,you fucking idiot. There's the bath!That's the... kids' toilet.- Is it?- Yes!Why's it got a plughole and a tap, then?Cos it's for checking your kid's shitbefore you flush it.- Urgh, that's grim!- Yeah, I know.That's the Continentals, innit?They're dirty.See? That looks nice!I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtubfor two weeks, Simon!We'll have to share the sofa bed.Ooh, 'ello!Right, well, while you two decidewho gets first go on each other's cocks,I'm getting ready and getting out there.The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,you know.CharmingFinally, smelling like anindustrial accident at the Lynx factory,and looking like the world'sshittest boy band, we hit the town.- Ooh, heads down, boys.- Shit.What? Why? We haven't done anything!- Foreign police, innit?- So?Don't you even know about foreign police?What, short-sleeved uniforms?Chunkier truncheons?- Oh, fucking hell!- Mate, they're all corrupt.Basically, if you misbehaveand don't have the money to bribe 'em,they take you upto these shepherds' huts in the hills,beat you up and bum ya.And if they don't kill ya,you kill yourself,cos of the shame of getting a bonerwhilst you was being bummed.Right, couple of things. Firstly,the hills here are full of timeshares,not deserted shepherds' huts.Secondly, Crete's in the EU,so I think the standard of policingprobably goes beyond bummingand forced suicide.Believe what you want. I'm keepinga bribe up my arse just in case.You're gonna spend the whole holiday with20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole?It's been up there sincethe seatbelt signs went off, mate.All right, lads! Holiday, is it? I'm outhere on my own, having a mental time!Can I have a beer?- Oh, here you go, mate.- No, you can't!All right, which is it?You say yes, he says bloody no.He's not your boss, is he? Eh?Well, it's been great talking to you,but we've really got to get a move on.Can I come round yours for a shower?Um, no.No? Cool beans. See you later, lads!Richard, yeah? Richard!Well, Richard was clearly mental.But as we were about to discover,so was everything else here.# This place about to blow# Blow# This place about to blow# Blow# This place about to blow# This place about to blow... #While Simon was seeingCarli everywhere,- Jay was seeing some very lucky ladies.- She'd get it.Most definitely!Oh, and that one. She'd get it!- And that one! And that one.- And that one. She'd get it.Right in the bumholey.I can't believe I've already got a bird.Gutted.So fucking what?! All birds know -what goes on tour stays on tour.No, I couldn't do that to Nicole.I think I love her.And I never loved anything beforeapart from a car or a sandwich.All right, lads!Are you up for a good time?Yeah, we're always up for a good time.We're the Pussay Patrol.All right. Well, if you really arethe Pussay Patrol...- Which we are.- You're obviously going to Marco's.It's the mostbuzzing bar out here.Always packedwith a chilled-out, sexy vibe.- Know what I mean?- I don't really know what you mean.When you say \"sexy vibe\",do you mean girls?Course! Loads of girls.I'll sort you out half-price drinksand a free fishbowl.Cool, cool, cool.So, will you be in there,with your sexiness,making the vibe all... sexy?Being all sexy, and that, sexy?Say \"sexy\" more.Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,you saucy bugger!Come on, then!Here you go, these four. I'll see youin a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.Large one?Saucy! See you later.Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!Yep! He shoots, he scores.Right up the vag.Oh, my God, if she's outside,imagine the birds inside!Ah. Interesting.Well, it must get going a bit later.She did say it was amazing.And why would she lie?!All right, mate. Four pints, fourJägermeisters and a fishbowl, please.Hello.- When it good here?- Sorry?Er, when here party good?In normally about an hour or two.Oh. Well, as we've paid,maybe we should hang on, then?But this year... never.- Thanking you, very much.- OK, let's go.Fuck off! My bird'll be down in a minute.Do you mean the woman who's clearlyon commission to trick peopleinto this empty bar?No, I mean the little hottie outsidethat I was flirting with.I'll take that as a yes, then.I'm going nowheretill she's sucked me off!- So you're going nowhere.- Jay, we're on holiday!I'm meant to be out there, trying tohit on girls I think are beneath mebut who, for their part, won't give methe time of day! So, let's go!Ooh! Hello, hello! It's those littlelovelies from the coach!- That one's not so little.- I think they're looking at us.And not in a weird, terrified,\"leave us alone\" way. Amazing!Jay, you're drunkest.Go over and talk to them.Nah. Not me, mate. None of themare as fit as my one outside.Why go for hamburgerswhen you've got steak at home?If, like you, you have neither anywhere.It's up to you, then, Si.Oh, shit, really?I don't know if I'm over Carli.- Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!- Yes, I can.When you stop beingsuch a pussy about your ex.It's time to get backon the horse now, Si.And those little ponies need feeding.Feed the pony.Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,but we've all got to go over together.- Great.- You fucking sad cases.You don't just walk upto a girl in a club...and introduce yourself!That's creepy.Clubs have different rules,you dick.Look, you dance over near them, makethe eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.Really?!- Annoyingly, that does sound right.- Thank you!And then, after a bit,you stand up behind them,pretend to slap 'emand fuck 'em up the arse.- That might be a bit much.- Yeah, I dunno...- Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.- - What about Nicole?It's only dancing,she likes my dancing.Stick with me,you'll be fine.Right, then, Si.Looks like the holiday starts here.We No Speak Americano)Am I doing it right? Am I in time?Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.Copy Neil.Sorry. Do you mindif we come and talk to you?Cos you look nice, and, frankly, this isjust humiliating for everyone involved.Um...Sit down, Specs.Hello. I'm Lucy.Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon!I'm Simon.I'd better not get stuckwith the fat one.So, when Alisoninitially suggested Malia,we all thought,yeah, why not?It'll be ironic.Then we had a reality checkand we thought, do we honestly wannaspend 2 weeks somewhere being ironic,and obviously the answer was no,so then we looked at other places,but we realised, actually,we just wanna have a laughand go clubbing and get drunk...and be silly, and that this mightgenuinely be a good place to come,so fuck it, here we are.Just so you know, I've met a reallyfit bird, and she'll be along any minute.OK. She won't mind you talking to me,then, will she?If our dancing was bad...and it was bad...then our small talk was even worse.They were useless. It was up to me, andso I dived in with my best chat-up line.- I'm Will, by the way.- Alison.So, do this place hire you out assome sort of avant-garde dance troupeto scare the customers off?No. I lost my mind and agreed to comehere on holiday. What's your excuse?Sort of similar.I came out here earlier this summer andfell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,- so now I'm back.- Hilarious. Course you did.What was he, a barman or a waiter?- Waiter.- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?- Nicos.- Too good.I bet he's different to all the boysback home!Yeah. He understands women, for one.I'm sure he does.Must get enough practice.Not only had Jay not offeredto buy Jane a drink,he'd now stopped paying for his own.Meanwhile,Simon had finally found a subjecthe was sure Lucy would love.It was devastating cos she's definitelythe most beautiful girl I've ever met.She's so fascinating,she's really funny, you know.Oh, right. In what sort of way?Just like, you know when something'sfunny and people get it?Yes?So in that way. And also in a comedy way.Neil was a man of few words.But even for him, this was ridiculous.Luckily, he had a trump card to play.D'you wanna dance?Meanwhile,Alison didn't seem to be enjoying...my hilarious Greek waiter impression.So, I presume he wooed you with the old,\"Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!\"You hh'only girl for me!There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!\"Oh, wait, here comes the next planefrom Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby\".Sorry, you do realiseI'm not playing along with the joke.I do genuinely have a Greek waiterboyfriend called Nicos.No, of course you do.Brilliant. Nicos.You've really nailed the clichés.- You are joking, aren't you?- No.His grandmother has as moustacheas well if that makes the stereotype...even funnier.I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not likeevery other waiter out here.It's fine. You don't knowwhat you're talking about.Your accent was pretty good, though.Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to missmy stereotypical Greek boyfriend.He might get angry and smash some plates.Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.You're not normal, are you?So then Carli said we needed some space.And uni's coming up,- so maybe she's right.- Sorry, who's right?- Carli?- Who?Carli, my ex?You went out with a girl called Carli?You should've saidWhat? I did!That's all I've been talking about.Oh!Yes, I was joking!Sorry for going on about her. I usuallyget a smack in the balls to stop me.What?!Um, nothing.You all right, Lise?Where's that bloke you were dancing with?# I've got nothing but love for you# I've got nothing but love for you# I've got nothing but love for you... #Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,and I don't want to miss him.So, shall we all hang out again sometime?Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.If I hear another bloke out hererefer to women as \"gash\", I'll scream.- Yeah, yeah, yeah. No that is horrible- It's awful...- when men do that. Disgusting.- Really bad.Do you fancy coming to the all-dayboat party, Friday?I know it's meant to be sold out, butour rep reckons he can still get tickets.All-day boat party - what's that?Well, it's a party.OK.- All day.- Yep.- On a boat.- Oh, right.Well! Now that's been cleared up,we should go.See you later, Will.Amazing.Do you realise, we just danced over,chatted up some girls,they loved it and you didn't fuck it up!- Me?!- Are we players?I'm starting to think that here, unlikeat home, we might actually be players.Maybe. I'm not really surewhat that means.However, cos I've not slept nowfor two days, I'm going to bed.Yeah. My eyeballs feel likethey've got paper cuts.- Jay, are you coming?- Fuck that!There's a fit bird up therewho's so wet for me,I can hear the waves breakingin her fanny.I'm gonna down this, then take her downthe beach and fuck her brains out.Right, well, we've establishedthat isn't happening.Fine. Watch me.Mm. ClassyWe'd better get Neil.- Neil...?- Oh, God! We're off.Right. Won't be a minute,I'll just finish up here.Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?Right.Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.He's definitely picked up the pace.While Neil picked uphis finger-banging speed,we picked up Jay - and he hada chilling prediction to share with us.She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.You watch.I'd rather not watch,if it's all the same to you.Shit, is that Carli?Look, Si, it's normalthat after a break-up,you'll think you see her everywhere,but she's not here.Yeah. I suppose.- Could be her.- What?Could be her.She is out here at the moment.What?!Well, we weren't sure wherethe best place to go was,and her and her mates are pretty cool,so I asked them where they was goingand when, and that's why I booked Malia.You fucking idiot!I came away to try and get over her!- Did ya?- You know I did!Oh, yeah, course.Oh, God, look at her.Do you think this is fate?Her being here, me being here.No. I think Neil asked herwhere she was goingand then booked the same place,like he just said.Let's go before she sees us!No, no. I've got to go and talk to her.If there's even the slightest chanceof us getting back together,I've got to take it.Carli!Carli?Simon?!Oh, my God! What are you doing here?Stalking you abroad.No. The opposite, actually.Just a mix-up by my friends.My stupid fucking idiot friends.Well, whatever. It's great to see you.Is it?!Yeah, it is. Course.Course.So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?How about right now?Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll beat the boat party on Friday, right?The boat party? I was literallyjust talking about the boat party.It's gonna be amazing. The best wayto round off our holiday.What? Why are you going? Don't go.I've got to go.My flight leaves on Saturday.The boat's our last chance to party.Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,then.For total, one million per cent.Definitely.Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.- I've missed you.- Hmm?Argh, Jesus!- Fuck it!- Sorry, mate.- James! Are you all right, Simon?- Yeah, fine. Argh!I'll walk it off.Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,we've gotta go.Oh, do you two know each other?Yeah, James is our rep.Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out clubnights. A bit of party organising, PR...Just make sure everyone's havinga good time, you know what I mean?- Are you sure you're all right, mate?- All good...Cool. Carls, come on.Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.See you, mate. Mind that leg.I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.Oi, baby, you stood me up!Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.Come on, kiss me.I'm working, darling.I love your boobs.What?!What gives you the right to touch me,you fucking prick?Wha...?Sorry, I think he might've hada little too much of the old drink.I am sick of every dickheadthinking he's got touching rights,just cos I smiled at him.It's my fucking job, you cretin!Are you on the blob?Sexy. I like it.- No, Jay. Time for bed.- Fuck that!You two can bum yourselves to deathon the sofa bed.I'm going to get another drink.Jay, don't be insane.You're too drunk already.I'm on fucking holiday.You can't be too drunk!- You coming, Neil?- Nah, I like it in there.And not sleeping for two nights is prettymuch the same as not sleeping for one.Right, fine.Fucking knobheads.How was your chat?Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's whatshe was worried about, us being apart.That's why we split up.But we're not apart,because we're both here.I just need to get on that boat.Actually, can one of youse help me?I think she might be a two-man job.What happened to your leg?- Oh, I got a little bit run over.- \"A little bit run over\"?!The next morning,I was woken up...by what sounded likeBigfoot having an asthma attack.Simon...Simon!Christ, it's like a sauna in here.Have you got any water?What the fuck is that noise?I think it's Neil.Oh, no, not the dinner ladyfrom last night!I cannot understand a thing you say.Spunk all over me bastard tits.Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.Fucking smack it!Smack it, you little prick!Is that all you've got?- Shall I bite it?- Interesting question.This is beyond creepy.Twist it right fookin' off!OK, I'm getting out of here!Harder!How can I have spent 100 euros?Holy shit,I only budgeted 15 euros a day!Great,so I spunked all my money...- in one night.- All right!Oh, Jesus, Neil!Oh, don't worry about that.It's on the way down.- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?- Who?Nicole, the girlfriendyou've just cheated on?Oh, no, no, cos we weren't kissingand only the tip went in.Any more than the tip is cheating, and Iwould never do that, cos I've got ethics.- Right...- Anyone want breakfast?No, I'm going to goto the Palace Hotel.It's where those girls we metare staying.Well, at least you've foundsomeone to stalk,other than Carli.Ow! Not me, Neil!Lucy reckons their rep can still get boatparty tickets, actually.Yeah, I'll come. Alison was nice. Neil?Can't, I had a nightmare.I left my trunks in England, didn't I?Wear your Calvins.They're practically the same.- Can I, Will?- Um, yeah, I suppose.- And can I bring a ball?- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.Cool. Oh, have you guys seen Jay?Shit, no, not since last night.No, I mean have you seen him?He's over there.So Jay had sleptface down in the dirt.But I'd woken up listening to Neilgetting sucked off.As far as I was concerned, he won.Urgh, ohhh!Face...!Yeah, you've got something on your face.It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.Argh! Pain!Tongue...It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.Not now she's been fed.Hey, lover?What the fuck was that?!Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotelwas nicer than our hotel.There are North Korean prison campswhich are nicer than our hotel.But, like a North Korean prison camp,it was overcrowded,so we had nowhere to sit.- What about there?- They've got towels on them, Neil.- So?- That means people have bagsied them.- We can't take those.- Fuck that!- No, Jay, we can't!- Watch me!It's probably just a load of Krautsthat got down early in the morningto reserve 'em.That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?- Jay!- Besides, I really need a lie down.My head's more fuckedthan Neil's dad's arsehole.Jay, please!Jay and Neil were off to,as they put it,\"check out the chicas\".But I had a serious problem.In the absence of my mother,or a teacher,I needed help with my sunblock.Simon, will you do my back?- No.- No?!- I don't want to touch you.- Unbelievable.Fine, I'll do it myself.Look all right,I'll do it with one finger.Thank you.You've got too much here.And here. I'll scrape it off.OK, but don't try and be funny and drawa cock on my back or something.No, course not.Right, all done.See, that wasn't so bad, was it?No, that was fine.I was really enjoying my book,blissfully unaware of the crudely drawnphallus burning itself onto my skin.Meanwhile, Jay was having troublewith his emergency funds.- Are you all right?- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,we've been spotted.Seen 'em.Look cool.Manchester.Manchester!- Who's this little twat?- You from Manchester?You like Manchester?- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.- No, you aren't.Shut up, Neil,the birds are loving it.- Goal!- Goal!Goal to Manchester! Yeah!No. Manchester, down.Yeah, hilarious.Now, get out the way.Whoa!Right. You're fucking dead,you little shit!Mate, just leave it, the chicasare looking, just laugh it off.No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.Oh! Alison. Hello!Hello. You know you've gota spunking cock on your back?What?Oh, no.Thanks, Simon, very funny,very mature. So I've been lying herewith a cock on my back, have I?Not for the first time.I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makesyou feel less self-conscious.It would, actually.We'd make quite the pair.You've got a really good spot here.Yes, Jay, um...sort of, um...Did he use some of his boyish charm?In a way, yes.I think I might start drinking again.Anyone fancy joining me?Um, yes, I will!Oh.Lucky meOh, I'm knackered.- Fishbowl hangover?- No. Nicos was over last night.Does not stop talking.No, we were having sex.Right.Sorry, does it make you uncomfortablewhen I mention sex?No! No, it's good,it's great that you're so...sexually active.Yeah, I suppose it is.- What's the best sex you've had, Will?- Well, um... hard to say, really.Come on, you can tell me.Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.Don't be boring, just tell me.Look, I'm going to level with you,I have never...put my penis in a lady.That's all right, you're a virgin,that's cool.It's definitely not cool.If anything, it's famously uncool.Well, it's cute, then.Oh, God, that's even worse.- You're funny, Will.- Well, that's something.Can I get a girl into bed for sexjust by making her laugh?Course you can.Wow! Great.If she's a clinical moron.Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.What a welcome.Nice to see you too.Yeah. Good. Now, can youstill get boat party tickets?I'd have thought so,I'd just have to go and find the rep.So are you coming along, then?Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.Great.Cos Carli's here. In Malia.And she's going to beon the boat tomorrow.If I can just get five minutesalone with her,I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.So, can you go and get those tickets?You really know howto make a girl feel special, don't you?Yeah. Yeah, I know.Carli is going to love it.Can you hurry up?Simon's plan was coming together.Meanwhile, Jane was about to experiencethe full force of Jay's boyish charm.Can you move? You're blocking the sun.Charming!What's happened to your face, Jay?It's a food allergy.I could do with one of those,maybe an iced-bun allergy.Yeah. You could.Meanwhile, Neil hada surprise in store for Lisa.Forgot my trunks.Fancy a swim?Oh, leave it out, you little prick.Right, that's it!I'm going to fucking kill ya,- I'm going to fucking kill ya!- Oi!Those are our sunbeds.And where's our towels?Oh, good.Well, there weren't any towelswhen we arrivedand we've been here for the last hour.I didn't ask to read your fucking diary,love. I said, \"Where's our towels?\"Now, there's no need to be abusive.If you look around,there are signs everywheresaying you can't reserve sunbeds.So you moved our towels?The point I'm making is,whatever the fate of the towels,these cannot be your beds.What have you donewith my fucking towels?!Sir, I get you nice other beds.Please, take up your stuff.Me?! What?Why should we move?Because he's made a scene?Because his family are too lazyto walk 20 feet to the pool?Seriously, mate, I am warning you.Why have a ruleif you aren't going to enforce it?The signs are redundant.My towel!Disabled. Course she is.Here you go.- Happy now?- Well, obviously not.And that isn't helping.You lot have got five secondsto get off my sunbeds.Right, come on, Will,we'll just find somewhere else.But I still don't seewhy we should move.Yes, his daughterhas a serious condition,but it's not like the whole familyare therefore entitledto pool-side seats for life.Plus, strictly speaking,she doesn't even need another chair.Are you guests at this hotel?Ah! No! I no swim!Please, mister, I no swim, I beg you.Not pool!Argh!All right. All right.It's just a joke! We're... We're mates!So little, so little!Ah!Great.And with a rough grabfrom a BO-ridden security guard,Simon's perfect plan came crashing down.- Thanks a lot, Jay.- Me?! What have I done?Oh, I don't know... Oh, yeah!Fucked everything up for me,like you always do.I had to teach him a lesson, Si,he was mugging me off.He was nine years old and couldn't swim!- Now my life is ruined. Thanks.- Is this about the tickets?Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!So, you don't get to goto the boat party, so what?!So I don't get back togetherwith the woman I love!Look, it's not my faultCarli thinks you're a prick.You want to watch me more closely, mate,- you might actually learn something.- Oh, yeah?And what would I learn?How to bullshit about having sex?How to sleep in an ants' nest?- How to be scared shitless of my dad?!- Oh, come on, Si, calm down.Maybe you'd learn not to be sucha massive tool over that miserable cunt.Don't call Carli a cunt!- You had enough yet?!- Have you had enough yet?- I asked first!- Ah...- Uh!- We should do something.Yeah, do you want to goand get a Subway?No. I meant about the fight,we should break it up.Yeah.All right, come on, you two.No!Uh!I'm sick of his bollocks,I'm going to fucking do him.Oh, you're hard, Si,I didn't see you do me just now.- Come back here, then, you prick.- Let's go for a walk!- Don't cry, Si.- I'm not crying!- You're crying!- Don't look like it, you're crying!- Come here, then.- See you later, then, Will.Honestly, I'm done with that arsehole.I mean, why do I evenhang round with him?Well, yeah, obviouslywe all wonder that at times.Look, it's been a tough couple of days,the Carli thing is weird,but just cos you werein a fight with Jay,- you don't have to leave.- I'm not leaving.But you are awareyou're packing your suitcase.- I've never liked him.- You've been mates since primary school.He's a little crybaby poof.And his hair,everyone took the piss out of that.But not me, I didn't.Fucking wish I had now.- You did a bit.- Well, no, course, a bit.But... not enough.He's a total twat!Oh, that's harsh, mate.He can be a knob, but he's not a twat.- I'm going to sell my clothes.- Oh, you're having a breakdown.She means so much to me, Will,I don't care about anything else.If I can get enough money together,I can buy a ticketfor the boat party off someone,somehow, whatever it costs.Money is all I need.I agree with you on money,but who's going to buy your clothes?No offence, but you dress appallingly.Are you going to helpor just constantly undermine me?- Bit of both, I'd imagine.- Fine.Do you think Alison likes me?13 years he's been dragging me down.Well... fuck him.- What's that?- Boat party tickets,I bought four the other nightbefore I passed out.Cost a fortune.I thought I'd surprise him.Well, here's his fucking surprise.- Oh, no, Jay, don't.- No, fuck him!And fuck that dick Will too.What shall we do now, then?Now we have the best holiday ever...- and do what we came here to do!- Get better at swimming!No.Go on Pussay Patrol!Unfortunately for him,Simon wasn't the only person in Maliatrying to sell shit no-one wanted.- Looky, looky. Hello?- Hello!- Looky.- Nice lady, good price.Clothes? Looky, looky.Top clothes for sale.You want clothes? Good price.I think you'd have more luckselling the big glasses.Isn't that Carli's friend?He's a rep,I don't think they're really friends.All right, mate?What's this,the world's shittest boot fair?Ha! No, just selling my clothesfor some money.I need money, desperately.All right!

Cheers, Abdul, good luck, mate.James isn't coming back, is he?Don't think so.Brilliant.So we made Simon some makeshift pantsand headed home to get changed.Simon,- please, don't fart in my T-shirt.- Sorry.In just 24 hours, Malia had pretty muchbroken me and Simon,so in a way I had to admireJay and Neilas they rolled up the sleeveson their offensive T-shirtsand dived straight back in.This place is mental.It's decadent, Neil,that's what they call it.This is what we came here for.You wouldn't find those othertwo muppets in a place like this.They'd just shit themselvesand run away.And now all the wayfrom Privilege in Ibiza,we have a very, very special act.It's probably some fit dancerwho'll take one look at me...and wanna bang me all night.Yeah, and we've got the best view.I bet you'll be able to seeright up the snatch from here.This is it, Neil,this is a fucking holiday.Ladies and gentlemen, welcome...Fernando!Must be like a cage fighteror martial-arts type thing.Whoa!Is this a bit gay?No, it's decadent.Let's have a big cheer for Fernando,the master of self-fellatio!I don't know if I like decadent things.Jay and Neil never told ushow close they came to Fernando's cock,but they did say they could smell it.And they were still havingmore fun than us.Last two, shall we pretendthey're pudding?All right, fellas?Romantic dinner, is it?I've just had a 'mare, right?Some massive body-building geezercame running out the bushes at me,God knows why. Anyway,I've lamped him, he's gone flying...I think I mighthave killed him.OK, well, it's been lovelyto chat, Richard...- Can you lend us 50 quid?- Um, no.Simple and clear. 30?- No, we're going.- Are we? Where?Terrible bar I know.See you later, Richard.10? 10?10? 10? 5?!Here, look, it's that James blokeCarli's sucking off.Oh, yeah.See, now that looks like a proper laugh.Neil, I think it's time the Pussay Patrolrecruited some new members.You all right, mate?Do I know you?Yeah, we're mates of Carli's.Ah, yeah.Carli Cling-on.Nice girl, bit keen.Yeah.Our mate's in love with her,- the fucking dick.- Oh, is he?Well, tell him he can have a sniffon these if he's lucky.Yeah, well, no, he's not really a mate.We ditched him, yeah, he's too tragic.It's a wicked place, this. Nice vibe.What, you think a blokesucking his own cock is wicked?Are you bent?No, course not.We're the Pussay Patrol.Pussay Patrol?!More like the Bumming Brigade.The only pussy you'll get will be a cat.Oi!I said, the only pussy they'll getwill be a cat.You know, like one of them stray catsyou get round here.- Oh, good one!- Fuck you, you lanky prick.You two are fucking me off.Get out of my face.Oh, no, come on, we're having a laugh,we're all right here.You're not fucking all right anywhere,you scrawny little shit.Now fuck off before I puta glass in your throat.You all right, Jay?Yeah.Are you crying?No, it's just the smoke in here.There isn't any.Yeah, that's what I mean.Do you want to go somewherenot decadent?So what happens now?It's probably a bit farfor my dad to come and pick us up.- Oh, great.- Be nice,maybe he's come to apologise.All right?We were just leaving, actually.- Oh, don't cry, Simon.- I'm not crying.No, Jay, it was you that was crying,- remember?- Neil!Come on, Si, sit down,let's all share a fishbowl.- We're totally out of cash.- Yeah.We're not all lucky enoughto have had a relative die.Well, you're clearly fucked without me,so I was going to offerto pay for your drinks,but if you're goingto be a baby about it,- then fuck it.- Were you really?Well, I'm not arsed either way,but if I have to... yes.Si?All right, thank you, Jay.Shake.Group hug?Oh, go on, Neil,just one more suicide shot.Fuckin' hell.Right. Tenner, please.- Sorry, mate, had my fingers crossed.- Oh, not again!Oh, my God!I never expected to see them again.Doesn't matter, though, does it?Cos even if Lucycan get a ticket for the boat party,I now can't afford one.Yes, but incredible as it may seem,Simon, I wasn't thinking about you.Hi, guys.Taking a break from drowning children?We are.And welcome back to Malia'sleast-cool bar.We're regulars, obviously.Surprised to see you here again.Well, it's the only place we've beenwhere the blokes weren't total animals.I'll take that as a compliment.Hello, by the way.Hello, Spectacles.Still going to get shit-faced, though.Shots only?- Are you man enough, Jay-bo?- Course.Thought you would be.Clearly, Alison was out of my league.But then all girls I likeare out of my league.Look at me. Imagine my league.It had to be worth a go.So I've been thinking, about us...- What, the four of you?- No, me and you.Well, there is no \"us\",so that must have been a weirdthought process, but go on.- I'm not sure Nicos is right for you.- Interesting.Why wouldn't my sexy, charming,caring boyfriend,who is also a sensational lover,- be right for me?- You'd say sensational, would you?- Mmm.- Mmm.It was nice of Richard Bransonto lend you an outfit.It's Neil's. Is it really that bad?Well, at least you look fantastic.Right, there's only one thing for it,we're going to say \"fuck it\"and do shots until one of us is sickthrough our nose. My money's on me.Four monkey brains, please.I like this Simon, he's fun.Thanks very much.- Cheers!- Cheers.Oh, actually, can you pay?Right, next!No, no. I can't have another one.I'm sorry, didn't realiseyou were a lightweight.- What?- Lightweight. Light-weight.You're one to talk about lightweights.What do you mean?Oh. Cos I'm fat?No.What I... mean, Jane, is...I'm gonna drink you under the table.You're trouble, aren't you?You're funny.That is why I know you don't haveto worry about getting laid.Um, did I say I was worried?No, but it's obvious that you are,and you thinkthat somehow I'm the answer.Well, I am not, and you will be fine.I think you might be, though.Nonsense.You know, in fact, I am so confidentI will make a pact with you.If you still haven't had sexby this time next year,I'll have sex with you.As long as I'm not with Nicos,of course.Of course.Um...this is a joke, right?A handshake's good...is it possible to get it in writing?See? Funny.Yes, ha-ha-ha. Hmm.You all right, Lise? Where's Neil?He is literally incredible.Come on, Lise,we're getting out of here.Let's go for a swim. Come on, you.You coming swimming?Oh. I can't cos I haven't broughtmy swimming costume.Oh, no! I haven't brought mine either.Really? What are you going to go?Well, I'm going to go in naked. Are you?Oh, right. Yeah, me too.Totally naked.Are they really going skinny dipping?- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.- Really?- Fucking hell, really?!- Yes.And......what about you?Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.Course.So I reckon I've got timefor a quick dip.Obviously, Alison and mewas never going to happen.And yet, and yet...No, I had no fucking chance.Come on. What are you doing?Get it off.No, yeah. Good. I will.Go on, then.All in good time.I'll look away, if you like.Um, yeah, that would be nice, thank you.OK, so, I'm looking away now.And so, for only the second time today,Simon was tricked into getting naked.Further along the beach,for the first time ever, Jay was closeto seeing some naked womennot on a computer screen.Come on, Jay, don't be shy.I'll take it all off if you will.Um, all right, just...give me a minute.Are you scared that you won't be ableto control yourself?She's a big girl.She is a big girl.Can't take it any more,just give us a snog.Um... all right.But... let's go somewhere secret.Secret?Just give us a snog here.Nah.Let's go somewherepeople can't see us.- OK?- Fucking whale on the beach.Actually... forget it.I've already seen your cock,and it wasn't pretty.All I'm saying is that, logically,we might not have to waita year to have sex.- Oh, really?- Yeah.I mean, once you remove Nicos from theequation and think, as I say, logically,it really makes no senseto wait that long.Do you find that your logictalks a lot of girls into bed?Well, no.I was just curious to knowwhether this kind of relentless, pedanticchat is a big hit with the other chicks.- Well, obviously it isn't.- Thought not.What are you waiting for?Um... I don't know.OK.Take your clothes off.That's it till next year, I'm afraid!I've lost my glasses.I've lost my glasses!God, it's freezing in here.Don't be such a wuss.Ah!That's right,let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.Right, how's this for a wet look, then?Oh, shit, sorry.Carli!Carli, over here!Carli, over here! Carls!Carls.Come on, Will, it feels amazing!Just getting my glasses!You're not wussing out on me, are you?Nope! As soon as I'm not blind,I'll be right over with youand the other naked ladies.Well, hurry up or I'm getting out!Jesus Christ, come on! Where are they?- What the... fuck are you doing?- I'm really sorry,I tripped. I've lost my glasses.You've got a big problem now, mister,a big fucking problem.Oh, God. I'm so sorry,I didn't knowyou were down there, doing that.Help!I'm really sorry, mate. Help me!Nicos?Alison?What are you doing?How does she knowyour fucking name, Nicos?Donna, I just need you to be a littlebit quiet for five minutes, please...Who the fuck is that?!Come and sit down with me,I want to talk to you.We're supposed to be meeting upin 15 minutes,- you utter, utter scumbag!- Glasses?- Glasses?- It's OK, it's OK.Glasses? Ooh!There they are.Alison, I love you, I love you,you are the only girl for me,there no other girl in my life.Now, where have we heard that before?Oh, just shut up, Will!Baby, you know this weirdo?I am not your fucking baby!Alison, wait!Simon.Are you swimming naked?Hell, yeah.- That's not like you.- Well, I'm on holiday,so who knows, maybe it's a new me?Oh, right.I like the old you.Hmm.OK, well, I'm off to bed.Can I come?To bed?- No, sure. I'm all wet anyway, so...- Look,I'm knackered, I've had a shitty night,I just want to be alone.But I'll see you at the boat party.We can catch up properly there, OK?Yeah, course.- See you at the boat party.- Great.See ya!- I miss you too.- Sorry?You said it the other night?Oh, yeah.Lucy! Lucy!Alison, wait! I'll come with you!- I want to be on my own!- Um...You're not expecting meto hit him or anything,- are you?- No!- Good.- I don't expectanything from anyonebut disappointment.You'll love me, then.And I will never have sexwith anyone again for as long as I live,and certainly not with you.So just fuck off!All of you, just fuck off!Does this affect our deal?Fuck your deal!Ahhhh!Lucy.Oh! Are you getting out?- Yes.- That was Carli, did you see her?Yeah.It was dark, but I saw her.Isn't she beautiful?Yes, she's very beautiful.I'm going now.Oh. OK!- All right?- I've been better.- What are you doing?- I'm thinking.About how shit the holiday is?Partly that. Partly I'm thinkingabout putting stones in my pocketsand chucking myself in the pool.Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.Right.Also, if you put stones in your pockets,you'll sink, so... better to nothave the stones, really.I'll bear that in mind, Neil.I stopped believing in God whenI realised it was just \"dog\" backwards.What?Well, when you think about it...G/O/D, D/O/G.It's like an anagram,but a backwards one, innit?Right.And then, after that,I just stopped worrying about stuff.You only get one go round, I reckon.When you're dead, you're dead.So you can spend your time thinkingabout how things haven't gone perfector you can just get on with it,have a laugh and that.That's what I do, I'm pretty happy.You are, aren't you?Yeah!Thanks, Neil. Thanks for that.Just remember, it's D-O-G backwards.No, not that.No offence, but that's moronic.No, thanks for coming to cheer me up.I didn't come to cheer you up,I come to say I did a shitin the children's toiletand I can't get rid of it.Oh, God!Cos I thought I'd try somethingdifferent, you know? As a treat.- Oh...- Oh!Oh!Neil, what the fuck has gone into that?Have you been eating tear gas?No, it's just a bit beery.And that meatinessis probably the kebabs.OK, that's it. Neil, you were right.It may not be paradise,but we can at least try and enjoythis place for exactly what it is.A shithole?Yes, but it's our shithole,so let's get out thereand get royally fucked upon Jay's dead grandad's money.It's what he would have wanted.If we get fined 50 euros, Neil,you're paying it.- But it's not on the floor.- Some of it is on the floor.Well, yeah, some of it.# I know you’re there# I know you’re there# I know you’re there# I know you’re there# I know you’re there# I know you’re there# It's my sound# It's my sound# It's my sound# It's my sound# It's my sound# It's my sound# It's my... It's my...It's my... #Is this normal enough for you?Probably a bit too normal.I'm almost going to miss himwhen I'm at uni.When he's at uni, you mean.- Yeah, but I'll be at uni too.- Will ya?- What, this year?- In a few weeks.Oh, what? Just cos Will's going?- No. 'Cos I want to.- Well... what about me?What?Well, what am I gonna do?Um... I don't know.Look, I thought you knewI was going to uni.Yeah, course. No, but...it's just that I was going to usemy grandad's moneyto set us up in business,selling car stereosto Premiership footballers.Neil was goingto work in the depot, but...me, you and Rio Ferdinand are on sales,like, having a laugh and that.Oh, right.Yeah, I'm going to do sociology.Fuck.I'm sorry I ripped your tickets up now.Could have had a bit of a send-off.- What tickets?- Boat party ones.I bought them when I was pissed theother night. I thought I'd surprise you.- Oh, well.- You what... You tore them up?!- Yeah.- What, after we had the fight?Yeah, I... I was angry'cos you had a go, and that.Yeah, no...Makes sense.You two go on,I'm just going to havea little recovery snooze.Come on, mate,you can have my bed tonight,this one's a bit bitey.Did I tell you I touched a boob tonight?Like... Like a real boob.A girl's one.I didn't get to lick it, though.This has been the best night of my life.It was the day of the boat party,and it looked like literallyeveryone in Malia had a ticket.Well, everyone except me and Simon,whose mood was now bluer than his balls.If I could, I'd give you my ticket, Si.You can, just give me your ticket.Yeah, but I really want to go,so you see, actually, I can't.- Take Jay's ticket.- No, I think he needs it.What, cos of Jane?No, in case the captain diesand they need me to drive the boat.Eased up on the vomiting,mainly retching now.For the record, they don't cleanthat toilet floor very often,lots of pubes on hands, knees...and my facewhen I had a little lie-down.I cannot believe we've been eating here.Wow, they look hot!- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?- Behave.Lucy. Lucy!Alison! Aliso...Oh. I give up.All right, boys? Who killed Will?- What's up with Lucy?- I don't know.If you ask her rather thantalking about your ex the whole time,- you might find out.- Oh, God, really?Fine.- You coming to the boat party, then?- You try and stop me.We just saw two hot fellasdressed as firemen getting on board.Might need a hand with their hoses.Might have to set fire to my knickers.- I'll come with you, if you like.- No, thank you.Come on, Lisa.You look as bad on the outsideas I feel on the inside.Oh, don't worry,I feel like shit on the inside too.Although...I don't have a pube on my cheek.Oh, God.Anyway, seeing you in such a messhas at least cheered me up a bit.Glad to be of service.You know I have a penissunburnt on my back too.Must be reassuring to knowthat however bad life gets,you're not me.It is.Good. That means every time you're down,you have to come and hang out with me.Yeah, I think I might.Starting with today.I've got Nicos's ticket for the boatparty. Do you fancy joining me?Um, yes.More than anything.Great. On one condition, though.Anything.At no point are you allowedto say, \"I told you so\".Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.So it's not that I'd rather goto a party that infinitely heightensmy sense of being out of kilterwith the rest of the world,it's just that Alison is sort ofthe fittest girl I've ever met- and maybe...- It's fine, Will, honestly.Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spotand hang myself.Great. Lucy, make surehe doesn't hang himself.I'm off.

This is my other cousin.He looks like he's going to beat me up.Hey. He's really nice.He just looks a little intense.What's your type anyway?Maybe you're looking for someone like me.Don't be so full of yourself.If only I had a siblingwho looks just like me.How would that work out?You're going to be my father.And my boyfriend would bemy brother's sibling?Then my boyfriend would be my uncle.Stop playing matchmaker.I know. Let's try Tinder.Just let it go.I just want you to be happy.I am happy.Happy like your mom and I?Pol.Don't feel sorry for me.I'm sorry Pol.You're home early.Mom I don't feel so good.I want to rest.Do you want me to make some soup?No thanks.I'll just rest upstairs.Did you and Migoy have a fight?Why do you think that?He hasn't texted me for a while.He's probably just busy.Pol!Pol!Pol!I'm sorry.His heart ailment recurredand this time it can't be cured by surgery.How are you?I thought I was ready.When Pol was young,the doctor said he might not live longand that his heart conditionmight come back.I kept hoping the doctor is wrongbecause he had the operation.I don't know what to do.I don't know what I'll do if I lose him.I don't know what I'll do…What did the doctor say, Mom?Nothing.He said you should just restand to avoid stress.Mom.I already know.I've accepted it.I'll just get more stressedif you don't tell me the truth.Mom.I've been prepared for a long time.I'm actually lucky tohave lasted this long.Don't talk like that.The doctor is doingeverything he can, okay?He's talking to a specialist in Singapore.We will do everything we can, Mom.But beyond that, we have to acceptwhat we have to.Who wants to die?But I should be grateful.I knew long agothat my life could be cut short.I'm glad I was given a chanceto live this long.Come on man.Don't talk like that.Let's look at it this way.You with all that information in your headwhat is the probabilityof a person dying at any age?Any time?Even without a disease.I could drown.I could get run over.I could even die in my sleep.In the end,we don't have control over death.I might live longer than either of you.Nothing's going to happen to you.You'll get better soon, okay?- Okay?- Okay.Come on. Let's go.Pol, did you see my keys?(Migs I thought I told youto stop looking for a partner for me?)(Why are you sending me photos? )(Stop it. I've accepted it.)(It's just too bad, I ended up liking you.)(I'm not expecting anything, okay?)(Just make my mom happy.)Claire.I'll just leave the two of you.Yes Ma.Can we talk.Can't do it at home.Pol might overhear us.Sure.Is there a problem?I read the text message Pol sent you.All this time I didn't knowhe felt that way for you.Why didn't you tell me?He made me promise not to tell you.Can you fall in love with my son?What?I pity my son, Migoy.If there's anything Pol hates the most,it's pitying him.And you think you know my son.He has acceptedthat I don't have feelings for him.That you're the one I love.He's happy for both of us.And all this time he has been hurting.He is sick, Migoy.Are we going to changewhat we feel for each other,just because he's sick?I love Pol too.He's my best friend.All I wish in this worldis for him to get better.But we don't need to sacrificeour feelings for each other for his sake.We need to break up.Why?Isn't it obvious?I can't bear hurting my son.If we're going to break up,it'll hurt all three of us.But we have more strength to handle it.He doesn't.He's still young.He can't handle the pain.What about me?Don't you feel bad for me?I'm young too, Claire!Now you're young too?I thought you were old enough for this?Have you ever triedlistening to Pol, Claire?What do you mean?You take care of himbut you never listen to him.And what right do you haveto talk to me this way.He's more mature than you think.Sometimes more mature than us.Let's end this.Don't set foot in my house.Who's the childish one now?I've made my decision.Do you need anything else?Sleep early alright?Mom, I'm not an invalid.Sorry my son.Mom?Has Migoy messaged you?He's not answering my calls.Mom?I thought you said no secrets?I won't be seeing him.Why?Did he do anything wrong?None.Don't you love him anymore?I do.Mommy.I read the text message you sent him.I broke up with him.Do you know what hurts me, Mom?You hurt me.You always treat me like I'm still a child.You never listen to me when I tell youthat I can take care of myself.You have to give me that respect, Mom.Give me that at least.That I'm no longer a child.That I'm responsible.Whatever I'm going through,whatever problems I have,I can handle it.Can't you give me that?What's keeping you awake?Sorry.Your Papa and I have been fighting a lot.I understand, Ma.At first, I was annoyed by it.But lately I realizedthat all that fightingis just a part of your relationship.That's part of how you love each other.That's why I shouldn't judge you.You have your own worldwhere you've decidedwhat kind of relationship you want.Thanks.You're right, you know.I can't live without your fool of a father.I'm sure he feels the same way.Ma.It's Pol.Why?What about Pol?He's sick.Claire has stopped seeing me.Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol?I'm sorry for what happened last night.I know I overdid taking care of you.No, Mom.I should apologizebecause I overreacted.It's right for you to take care of meand I should take care of you.Mommy?Can you please bring Migoy back?I feel bad for him.Yes, my son.Mom?Mom.Mom?It's not true that I sacrificedeverything for you.When I was pregnant with youand your Dad left us,I tried to abort you.The abortion failed.You survived.You were a miracle.You are a miracle.Since then.I blamed myself.That maybe the reasonwhy your heart is weakis because of me.Because I tried to kill you.So when your Dad came back,I was consumed by my guilt.I was never a good wife.I was very selfish.It's hard to admit one's faults.And I have a lot of faults.Mommy.Mommy, you're not at fault.Mommy.Pol...Pol?Pol?Pol?Pol!Pol?Pol?Pol!Pol!Pol!Pol!Pol!Pol!Pol!Pol!The fainting spellis an indication thathis condition is getting worse.Even the specialist in Singapore saidthat they can't do anything about it.How is he?Better now.He was probably tiredso I told him to go to bed early.I missed you.Love you.I love you too.I can hear you both.Jim, Pol wants to talk to you.Hi Dad.Long time no see.Hi Pol.How are you Dad?Pol I want to say I'm sorryfor all the years we never saw each other.Thanks Dad.You didn't use to have that accent.Your siblings are coming in a bit.Do you want to meet them?Yes Dad.You know, you look a lot like my youngest.Really?Son, how are you?How are you feeling?Well, Dad, I've been managing.Don't lose hope, okay?We'll fight it.I have a request.What is it?I once told Pol not tobe afraid to experiment...to fall in love...to have sex.He told me his first sexshould be with someone he loves.Migoy.While there's still time,while his illness hasn't worsened,I hope at least onceyou can give that to him.I know it's not easy for you to do.But I hope you can do this for Pol.He loves you so much.I just want him to experiencethis before he leaves us.Do you love me?So much.I love you so much too.And we love Pol, don't we?Does he know about this?Have you told him?Not yet.But if he says yes, will you do it?What?It's not going to hurt me.Nobody would get hurt.Why would you think something like that?What did Migoy say?He said yes.You don't need to pity me.We aren't pitying you.We just want to show youhow much we love you.Through sex?Why not?I just want you to experience everythingthat will make you happy.I just want to give youeverything that I can.Mommyyou have given me everything.It's not enough.It's not enough.Give me this.Do this for me okay?Do this for me.This will make me happy.Okay?- Good morning.- Good morning.I just want to pay forthe room reservation.Okay ma'am. That will be 3,000 pesos.I love you.I love you too.He didn't spend all of his allowance.It's all here.He saved it for you.So you could rest for a year.So you could write again.(May December January)"}

Nobody watches movies anymore these days.Hey, hey, hey, hey.Ah, this is \"Raihun\" (title of a movie).Do you know it if you watch it?Anna, a country girl, was deceived by a man and had a miscarriage.She hides the truth and works as a maid for a living.But she gets exposed and gets kicked out in the heavy snow.Lilian Gish, who plays Anna, is so beautiful, so I remember.What the... I've made upmy mind to burn the film reels.This theater was built by my grandfather, probably in the Taisho era.\"Raihun\" was released in Tokyo in 1922.The following year, this theater was established.My grandfather watched that film in Tokyoand decided to screen it as the first film at Asahi Theater.How can we burn such an important film?If we don't burn this important film, how can we make up our minds?They say a grocery store can survive for three generations.There's no choice. Times change, you know?Times change?If this place disappears, where will the locals watch movies?Who should I ask if you ask me?It has survived many disasters over the past century, even earthquakes.That means this theater shouldn't disappear even more.In the end, it was defeated by the COVID-19 pandemic.It will take another year or two to return to normal life.It can't hold on for that long.Relying on donations... and such?We don't accept donations. They should go to other theaters, right?It would be meaningful if other theaters could be saved.That's how I convinced myself and made up my mind to burn the film reels.Alright? If you understood, just leave.What are you doing?-I'm telling you... -What are you doing?What's going on?I stepped on something.I'll have a headache if this place is gone.I don't care what you do. I've already decided.I don't know your reasons, but it will give me a headache.Okay, fine. Go sightseeing then.I'm not here for sightseeing.Then why are you here?I'm here... to rebuild this theater.Huh?Someone asked me to find an old man with a beer belly...Um... that is... to find the person in charge here.They said the venue is good, but the film lineup is lousy, and they asked me to rebuild it.You're really stubborn, old man.What's with the \"old man\" attitude?Well, you're an old man. What's wrong with calling you that?Shut up, kid. I'm not playing around.I'm not playing around... ah!By the way, who are you?It doesn't matter who I am.It does matter. Being pointed at by a stranger...You better give me your name, or I'll call the police.Mogi...Mogi?Mogi Riko (sounds like \"ticket collector\" in Japanese).Right, Mogi Riko.I'm Mogi Riko.My real name is Asahi Hamano.Hamano as in \"seaside\" and \"field.\"During my first year of high school, the Great East Japan Earthquake happened.My dad used to work at a taxi company in Koriyama.But all transportation companies were afraid of radiationand didn't send cars for decontamination workers.So, he decided to go to Minamisoma alone to be in charge of transportation.Gasoline was scarce, and natural gas taxis were in high demand.At first, he received praise,but when it was known that he made a lot of money,people's attitudes changed, and they accused him of profiting from the national disaster.His company was called \"Hamano Asahi Transportation.\"And my name, including both my first and last names, was associated with it.As a result, my family faced harassment.My mother and younger brother, who stayed in Koriyama, were also ostracized.Our family was on the verge of falling apart.Because of those rumors,I lost all my friends. They all left me like the receding tide.Hey.How did you get the key to the rooftop?You can't go up there without permission from the teachers.-Sorry. -Hmm.So... how did you get the key?I... made a spare.Huh?I also have a spare key.This place is nice for some alone time.But... it's not good if you jump from here.What's with that expression?Why...I've seen you before.And you're kind of famous at our school too.Every time, you look like you want to die.Today, seeing you like that, I had to stop you.It's like I'm the monitor for the cliffs of Toshinbo or something.It's up to you how you want to do it; it's your freedom.But now is also my precious time to relax.If someone jumps off a building in front of me, it will be traumatizing for my soul.I heard you're transferring to another school?Where are you transferring to?Tokyo.Tokyo is great. I used to live there.It has everything and is very convenient.But I don't want to go.Maybe it's better than living here with no friends.I've been here for years, and I still have two more to go.I feel really sorry about it.But... the world is not just this place, you know?Come with me.This place is perfect for secretly watching movies.Here we are.Hey, Tanaka-sensei. Are you using this room?Sorry, Principal. I'm tutoring a student.Okay, I just saw the door was unlocked.Goodbye.Take care.That was close. Thankfully, it hadn't started playing yet.Dad, it's because he doesn't truly love someone that he acts like this.If you love Mom, why did you abandon her?If you don't want to leave Mom, why don't you love her?Dad is just full of liesDad, please use your true heart to love Mom(The end of the play)You can't tell on DVDs, but with film,say half the time is pitch black.Do you have a notebook?I need a pen too.Film is made up of frames, 24 frames per second.When you connect them, it becomes a film strip.To project it onto a screen, you need a projector.The projector allows light to pass through the film and onto the screen.But there are lines between each frame of the film.If you directly project it continuously, you'll see those lines.So the projector uses a shutter to block those lines.The shutter has notches that look like a fan.Between the fan blades, a brief ray of light emerges.The shutter only allows light to pass through the fan blades.It relies on the lingering afterimage of that moment to carry over to the next frame.Have you heard of the phenomenon of visual persistence in human eyes?It means that half the time, you're looking at a dark screen.Sounds quite interesting, doesn't it?Half the time, watching darkness, yet still moved and laughing.That's why movie enthusiasts tend to have a gloomy personality, right?But that's not a bad thing, right?Tokyo has many movie theaters, you know.Mostly multiplexes, I guess.Let me tell you something.Imagine what it will be like 100 years from now.Anyway, you won't be in this world by then.How about it?I thought you were going to say something inspiring.Can adults who say such things be trusted?Anyway, it's okay not to hurry and die today.\"It's okay\"... It sounds strange to say \"it's okay.\"Riko Mogi?Yes, Mogi... Riko Mogi.I'm Riko Mogi.Mogi... the ticket collector...Are you messing with me, you little brat?I'm serious, that's my real name. I won't change it.You can't even speak clearly.I was born for movies, and I can operate projectors too.Once you teach me, I'll be able to do it.I told you, we're closing.There's no need to hire anyone.And even before the pandemic, nobody came anymore.Although I'm the owner, my real profession is electrical work.Otherwise, how could I make a living?There was a time when movie theaters were busier than electrical work.But that was a long time ago.But... we don't need to demolish it, right?I've already talked to the real estate company.A company wants to buy this place, saying they'll build a large public bath.They'll set up a small stage and invite singers.They'll also create a rehabilitation center on the second floor.Benefiting the community, benefiting the people.Which real estate company are you talking about?Why do you want to know?Never mind. Which one?Sorry, I wanted to ask about Asahi Theater.Oh, what about Asahi Theater?I want to know which company wants to buy it.And if it can be prevented from being demolished.Uh... something like that...Yasuza!Oh, Who is this young lady?I don't know either...He's my relative. My grandmother asked me not to let it be demolished...What's going on...?-I don't know... -That theater was built by my ancestors.-My grandfather -Yes, so we are... relatives.His grandfather's cousin's grandniece is my grandmother.My grandfather didn't have any brothers...My family moved away, but we never forgot this theater.Not only my grandmother, but our relatives in Koriyama also want to preserve it.I don't have any relatives in Koriyama...Movies... It won't do if the movie theater is gone, right?I've been going there since I was a child to watch movies...Yes, spending two hours in the darknessand entering another world.Escaping the pain of real life.After watching, we return to reality, but with added motivation.Movies can't fill our stomachs, but... but...Life feels a bit lonely without movies.Right, so...I'm in debt.I couldn't make a profit anyway, and air conditioning costs a lot.I've held on until now, but I've reached my limit.- If you understand, go home. - How much money?How much money do you owe?- Why should I tell you... - How much exactly?4.5 million yen.Yasuzo.What's there to be afraid of? It's not money owed for food, drink, gambling, or prostitution.It's to save the theater. There's nothing shameful about it.Running a theater is not that different from gambling.Although they say distant relatives are not as good as close neighbors,But isn't it a good thing that distant relatives are so proactive in helping?By the way, you actually have sucha young relative?Relative?She said she's a relative, but I've never seen her..Um... when is the deadline for repaying the debt?Well, it was bought by the owner of \"I Enterprise.\"The handover date is on the 25th of next month.I'll contact them and see.- Please. - I Enterprise... I Enterprise...Such a good company. They really rest on Saturdays and Sundays.- They're closed today. - I see.Anyway, I'll figure out a solution myself. Thank you.What a shame.what are you doing?I want to try Crowdfunding.Oh, like fundraising?There are fundraising options, but it's easier to succeed with rewards.What do you mean by rewards?Tickets to this cinema or souvenirs, for example.Excuse me, sir. Can I film the audience seats?Miss Riko Mogi, that's enough.No, we can't give up.It's already enough that you, an outsider,an outsider, have such goodwill.(Closure Notice)When I was talking to the real estate agent earlier,I lied, but you didn't expose it. Why?You actually want to keep running the theater, don't you?I used to work at a film distribution company in TokyoBut it went bankrupt due to the pandemic.Of course, it's not just the film industry that's struggling.People in all industries are having a tough time.But I had finally gotten the hang of my job,and I wanted to introduce interesting movies to theaters.But one theater after another closed down.Without theaters, there's no way to screen movies.That's true...These days, the most important thing is having food on the table.Those who produce rice and vegetables are truly remarkable.I'm grateful for them.but…The people who work hard every day in the fieldsprobably have a part of them that relies on movies,art, music, things that don't fill the stomach,to soothe their souls.My younger brother is a rice farmer, and he loves watching movies.He must want the theater to keep running...He took his own life.The year after the earthquake.After enduring great tribulations, he still worked hard to grow good rice.He came here to watch a movie before he died.Movies can't save people... It's not the movie's fault either.But there's nothing we can do. A movie can't save the life of a rice farmer.That's a more accurate way to put it.We've reached the limit. No one wants to come watch movies anymore.The theater doesn't fit the trends of the times, especially in the countryside.I've done enough already.I appreciate your kindness. Thank you.But, it's already over.Do you understand? If you do, go home.Idiot.Idiot. It hasn't even started yet.Why are you quoting \"Bravest Number One\" at an old man like me?- I want to live in this town.- Ah?Nothing has started here yet.I transferred to Tokyo, but I still couldn't fit in with the new class.I had no place to stay at home either.I dropped out of school in the first semester of my third year of high school.Sorry, teacher...Well, then I'll go.Hamano.I wrote a letter saying I would come.Sorry for the bad timing...Hamano Asahi, from Hamano Asahi Transportation.Don't bring that up. What about your boyfriend?He's not my boyfriend. Who was he again?Long time no see. Why do you still have that \"I want to die\" look?i ran away from home.Really?Yes.What about school?I... I quit.A serious child like you chose a difficult path.What did you do in Tokyo?I just kept watching movies.Come in. Hmm.- Find a place to sit anywhere. - Okay.- Sit on the chair. - Ah.Thank you.- Phone number. - Ah?What's with the \"Ah\"? Your home phone number. I'll dial it for you.But…There's no \"but.\" Sorry, you're still a minor.I'm a teacher at Anami High School. I'm Mariko Tanaka.Your daughter came to my side.Can I keep her with me for a while?Sorry for the trouble, teacher. I don't know how to apologize.No, luckily it's summer vacation now.Please ask her not to cause trouble for her little brother.Ah... Okay. Goodbye.Sorry for the trouble, teacher.No, it's perfect timing. I was feeling down too.Let's go watch a movie.Help!So, I started a brief cohabitation with the teacher.Oh? Is this kid your former student?I'm not her mentor. We're just companions on the rooftop.What's that?Is she really a good teacher? Is there no problem?There's absolutely no problem. The students really like her.The students like me, right?What do they like about her?What do they like... Ah, she makes the students carry condoms.Is that true?The parents would be shocked, right?It caused a commotion. I even bought them out of my own pocket.But it's all because the adults didn't teach them properly.I told them to carry them for their own protection.But then the parents had the school dismiss me. It was a big hassle.But the students started a petition, and the whole school signed it.That's impressive.You're just realizing it now.Luckily, the weather cleared up today.Really, this place is amazing. So comfortable.Oh? Wasn't the teacher goingto stay at his place for a date today?What happened?I got dumped.Huh?I got dumped.What's wrong with the teacher?I'm sorry. Are you staying at thehotel in front of the train station today?You found a new boyfriend so quickly?What are you laughing at?- Let's make it more lasting this time. Take it. - Okay.I'll do my best.I've already watched \"When a Woman Cries\" twice.I know. There won't be any problems this time.But every time a man comes, I'll kick you out.You're like a mother who abuses her child.Goodbye.Teacher Moriko is excellent, just unlucky in choosing boyfriends.She falls in love as soon as she hears sweet words,and then she gets dumped quickly.This movie isn't particularly tear-jerking,but the scene where the two dancers are abandoned by the same man,she cries every time she sees it. I really like that about her.Oh? Did the teacher work in the film industry in Tokyo?Yes, distribution. It means buying movies to screen in theaters.Oh, no wonder there are so many movie DVDs in her room.Yes, but that company went bankrupt in five years.And then my father, whom I cut ties with...Cut ties?He was an abusive alcoholic, a lousy dad who forced his kids to give him money.He found my address,came to my door demanding money, and it infuriated me.I wanted to cut him off completely, so I gave him all my savings.At that time, my boyfriend said he wanted to go back to his hometown in Minamisoma,so I followed him, hoping to force him to marry me.You already had a teaching certificate back then?Yes, I wanted to teach in the countryside, and I actually got hired.My boyfriend and I broke up quickly,and unexpectedly, I found joy in being a teacher.Then I got transferred to Koriyama.What happened betweenyou and your father after that?I haven't seen him in 10 years, I think.My hometown is in rural Kyushu,and I'm sure all the relatives andneighbors are cursing me for being unfilial.Why is it like that?Many people believe blood is thicker thanwater and that father and daughter can reconcile.But that's just an illusion.Come on,hit me too. If you don't, let's end it.Hello.Hmm, she's is doing well. Don't worry.Yes.Oh? Yes.I understand how you feel, but please understand your daughter...She has her own life too...But…I see. I understand. I disagree.Yes, use the cosine formula over there.After all, summer vacation is ending, and you don't have any homework.I had a part-time job to experience the real world...Don't talk back. Solve the problem quickly.Done.That was fast.But why are you telling me to study now?I think education isn't that important.But what do you want to do in the future?In the future...You see, you have no idea, right?That's when you need this. The High School Equivalency Exam.Have you heard of it?Go take the exam. People like you should go to university.But…Too bad. This society isn't so forgiving.If you have survival skills or a specific talent,then it's okay not to study.But do you have any specific talent?No... I don't.But why suddenly care about this?I received a call.From my mom?She said the neighborsfound out you ran away from home,and it wouldn't look goodfor your brother's school.So she wants you to come back home.I refused.She used to be... normal before.We have a good relationship.But...after the earthquake...She's constantly afraid of radiation and her temper has become increasingly strange.I've always been healthy.But my younger brother, Yuto, is weak and prone to illnessSo my mom has become worried all the time.My dad hasn't come home either.I see.Nothing I say matters.Only my brother, Yuto, can make her smile.Finished.That was fast. No wonder you went to our school.teacher?Are you... who are you?Huh? I thought you were Mariko. It's not her?- Ah. - Ah, bao!Welcome back!Mariko, who is this person?I told you before, this is my former student, Asahi Hamano.I know, the one who works in transportation, right?She doesn't like it when people mention that.I'm sorry, I'm Yubao Chen.I'm Hamano.Hamano, nice to meet you.Since bao is here, let's go out for a meal today, okay?Agreed. I want to go to a family restaurant.We don't have to be so frugal. We can have sushi or yakiniku.They have everything there. I like family restaurants.Family restaurant, family restaurant...Wait, let me change clothes...You scared me. My heart almost stopped.I wondered why the door wasn't locked.Sorry, the natural gas inspectorwas supposed to come.But I have to go to work, and you have a part-time job.So I asked Xiaobao.You gave him the key too quickly.I didn't give it to him. I just left it in the mailbox.You're too trusting.My home has never been robbed before.Bao, have you made your choice?I want... this one.(Corn Chowder, 150 yuan)No, no, no. Why choose this? This soup...Because it's still expensive.I've only been here once.I don't know the prices. I'm sorry.It's okay, let's order some meat.Bao, does it taste good?Bao is an intern.Yes.I don't want to be an intern anymore.I want to ruin this shop.Ruin it?Yes, ruin it.\"Burn it\" actually.Burn it! ?Mariko stopped me.I've been bullied by my boss.My internship ended, and they didn't pay me.I wandered the streets with no money.Nowhere to go, and I startedto hate Japanese people.I thought they were mean and loved to lie.So I wanted to do something bad to them.At that time, my mind wasn't right.Today, this shop is closed.What happened?Are you hungry?The ramen Bao wants to burn is a restaurant I often visit.It's a big deal when a place you often go to gets burned.So, I treated him to ramenand listened to his explanation.And then we started dating.The last step seems a bit sudden.- Never mind, it's fine. - Yeah, it's good.I didn't become a criminal,and I don't have to hateJapanese people anymore.Mariko found a new place for me to intern.She helped me a lot.I really like her.No wonder you've been busy on weekends lately.Yeah.Bao is cute, right?Mariko is cute.Really? Bao is cuter.Mariko is cuter, you know.Bao is cuter.Hamano is okay.He's annoying.Hello, I'm Inspector Jitsusen fromthe Minami Police Station in Koriyama.- You're Miss Mariko Tanaka, right? - Yes.You're suspected of kidnapping a minor. Can you come with me?And this person next to you is Asahi Hamano, right?- We received a report from Asahi's mother. - Yes.She said you refused to let Asahi go home.That's correct.Miss Tanaka, you're a school staff member.Haven't you considered the consequences?I have.Do you feel sorry for the child's situation?No, it's not about feeling sorry.It's just... I can't betray my friend.It's not the teacher's fault at all.But we received a reportsaying you were kidnapped...That was just amisunderstanding by my mother.It's true that you ran away from home, right?But I had nowhere to go. The teacher took me in.If it weren't for the teacher, I would have been on the streets.It's not the teacher's fault at all.Your mother said that if you come back home,she will withdraw the report and reconcile.I know you all have your reasons,but since we received a report, since we have to arrest her.Mariko... she still hasn't come out.Hmm.- Teacher! - Mariko!I'm sorry, it's all my fault.- It's okay, but... - It does matter.If I come out, it means you've accepted it, right?Of course.It's the evening showtime.I'll go this way.I'm going to the station.And... this is for you.This is the living allowanceyou were supposed to give me.No, I let you spend money on meals...How can I accept it?I'm a teacher with a stable income.- But... - Stop with the \"buts.\"Teacher, it's too much.- It's okay. - It's not okay.It's okay, take it and pay your tuition fee.You can keep 30,000 yen for watching movies and relaxing.Understood?Okay.Ah... um... please give my regards to Bao.And please try your best to flirt with Bao.Okay, understood.Goodbye.Please.Take it easy.Give me the money!Uncle, are you kidding me?I can't talk in front of the camera. I'm not an actor.Ask me to express my feelings for the theater. I can't do it.You should have some enthusiasm. Don't directly ask for money.Isn't it just fundraising? It's like a... mass movement.We need to give back to the people.But we can't give back much.Just do our best.Not everyone's crowdfundingapplication gets approved.We propose the content, and the platform determines its value.So if it doesn't pass the review, it's over. I've said it several times.Why are you so naggy?Do you find me nagging? Let's shoot it again, okay?Fine.Not cute enough. Come here.-I'll shoot it. -Okay, okay.Action.Come on, please speak.-Is it okay? -Yes, please speak.A movie theater, in the darkness,where a group of strangers gather,laughing in the same scene, crying in different scenes.The screen constantly displaysstories crafted by others.Although the stories are fictional,everyone watches the same imagesbut thinks different thoughts.I can't think of any other placethat provides such an experience.For a hundred years, enthusiastshave come in and out of theaters like this.My younger brother and I have beenwatching movies here since we were kids.We really love this theater.so…I don't want to lose it!(\"Aozora Musume\" \"When Women Cry\")Good morning.Oh, Riko.The Asahi Theater will be showing a movie soon.

Let me help you put it at the entrance.-Really? -Give me some more.Thank you. Give me a few more.Uncle?Uncle!Are you there?Get out of here, you old fart!You brat, what did you say?The crowdfunding has been approved!Really? I gave such a good speech, didn't I?No, it's not about that. The fundraising page is open now.These days, anything is possible.It's different from before the war.Do you think I'm that old?Abe, you're here.Oh, what's up?-I contacted Company I. -Really?What did they say?Oh, they're really angry.I thought so.But the formal contract hasn'tbeen signed yet, so there's still hope.The prerequisite is that we need to raise the money.It would be best to achieve it sooner.Do you know anyone fromTV stations or newspapers?This Asahi Cinema is facing a business crisis...\"\"Today is the release dayafter a month of absence...\"Oh, you made it!\"- Not bad, huh?\" - Yeah, feels good.\"This is the person in charge, Mr. Morita Yasuzo.\"What are you doing?Huh?

Sorry, I don't have a business card...No, it's okay.Please have a seat.- Excuse me. - I'm going to make tea.No need.They reported about this place on TV.After that, we received a lot of protest calls at our company.I helped you because I heard you didn't have money.Boss, about this matter...I apologize for making unilateral changes.I will repay the money you lent me.Can we just forget about demolishing this place?What?I know it's unreasonable to say such things at this point.But I don't want to lose this place.Even the locals have started coming to watch movies.Asahi Theater has become their gathering place.Is that so, a gathering place...Movies can provide some nourishment to the soul after all.It's something you can't experience without a movie theater.So, I still want to persist.Uncle, the next movie...Mr. Morita.Forgive me for being blunt, but this is purely emotional.An increase in customers is only a temporary effect after the media coverage.Besides, now people can watch movies online instead of going to the theater.Young people only watch YouTube these days.A large bathhouse that catersto all ages is more popularthan a theater that only shows movies.And with the maintenance facilities, people of all ages can use them.Isn't that right?Maybe so.But a movie theater has its own merits...Mr. Morita, please face reality.A large bathhouse and maintenance facilitiescan create employment opportunities in these tough times.Can this theater afford it?Dreams are good, but dreams can't fill your stomach.What's the right thing to do for this town and its residents?You might think I'm being heartless.I myself am from Banquets Village in Fukushima Prefecture.Banquets Village...So I have thought carefully...about what's best for this place.To be honest...I don't know if this is the right thing to do.But I'm certain I'm not wrong.And even if you repay the 4.5 million yen,we have already signed a contract with the demolition company.The demolition fee is 10 million yen. Can you compensate for that?A total of 14.5 million yen within the next month.Demolition fee?The company also needs to hire workers and coordinate equipment.You have to bear the cost of the demolition as well.Someone has to make a living from this.Depend on it for their livelihood.Goodbye.You heard that, right?Hmm.Demolition fee.Come to think of it, I was too naive.The demolition date has been set, indicating that we've already signed a contract with the company.14.5 million yen.I haven't even raised 10% of it.What's the right thing to do for this town and its residents...Something's not right.It's strange no one is coming all of a sudden.The movie schedule has changed too.People are just curious about the current topic, right?Crowdfunding won't make it.I'll go out and distribute flyers.Sorry.Welcome.Oh, the movie theater, right?Thank you for helping with the flyer distribution last time.The new movie schedule is out, and I'll need your help this time too.Sorry, but we have reserved posters to put up this time.We can't put up anything else. Sorry about that.-Good morning. -Welcome.-Is the shirt ready? -Yes, it is.Sorry about that.No problem.Hello, everyone.Asahi Theater will be showing new movies.\"The Great Abduction\" and \"Grand Torino.\"The second one is the one that Klinshu is in, right?Clint Eastwood.I like that actor.You know this Eastwood Actor?Yes, I do. Have you seen that car movie?\"Grand Torino.\" I haven't seen it.Then welcome to Asahi Theater to watch it.Sorry, we're a bit busy.Thanks for your hard work.- I still have to take care of that...- Go when you have time.She's back.Oh, welcome back.It didn't go smoothly, did it?Can we get a refund for the audience or something?You can get a refund by going through the procedure.I see.I understand. Let's get a refund then.Huh?I did my best and have no regrets.Wait a moment.I feel deeply regretful.After all, it was too strange. Everyone suddenly didn't show up.They ran away as soon as they saw me. There must be a reason.Don't blame the neighborhood residents too much.I heard that employees from Company I visited every household.Lobbying them?Yes.They said it would be more beneficial to the local area to keep the cinema and renovate itinto a large public bathhouse with maintenance facilities.They also emphasized the job opportunities it would create.With the current economic downturn, many people have no way to continue.Sons and daughters who went to work in other citiessaid they would come back if there were jobs here.\"Blood is thicker than water. Family is the most important.\"Everyone was convinced by such words.Many households here are single occupants or elderly couples..family…It can't really guarantee anything.That's right.Perhaps family is just an illusion.I think so too.And for the local people, this theater is important.If possible, I hope it can continue to operate.So, what's your point?Perhaps family is just an illusion.You're not wrong.but…This illusion... is everyone's solace.Take care.How long have you not seen each other?It's been about 10 years... or so.Really?The company is much bigger than I imagined.I worked hard in Minamisoma for six years.Later, they relocated the headquarters here.I see.So, what are you here for, Miss Riko Mogi?I saw you on TV.I never thought you would use a pseudonym.Because you randomly picked a company name,I was criticized and exposed in Tokyo.Do you hate me?It's a job that someone has to do, right?Is it worth destroying a family?It was Dad's fault that Mom turned out like that.Not only Mom, but Yuto was only 6 years old at the time.Everyone was very anxious, but Dad... wasn't around.Not just not around, but you left us.That's why you can live in Tokyo.Yeah.Well, that's why I could go to college.Mom wanted to go to Tokyo.Do you understand? The feeling of not being understood by your family.Even so...It's not right to make decisions on your own without telling your family.Even if I told them, they would just oppose it.Is that why you came here to say all this?You need money, right?How much do you need?No, it's fine.I... won't come again.Thank you for taking the time to see me.Yuto is in high school now.Mom's medication hasn't decreased, but she's stable.I'm sorry, teacher.(Bao)Mariko doesn't have much time left to live.The doctor said two weeks.Mariko has been talking about you, HinanoIf it's convenient for work, I hope you can come.Bao!Thank you, Hinano.Why didn't you inform me earlier?Mariko told me not to. I'm sorry.What illness is it?Breast cancer. It was discovered too late.Does the teacher know? About your health condition?She heard the doctor tell me how much time I have left.It's okay if the teacher knows, right?I fainted.Be stronger, okay?She said the same thing.Take me to see her.Teacher!Long time no see!You've become mature and beautiful.-How old are you? -25.-Sorry for the trouble. -No worries. Koriyama is very close.Is your health condition still okay?It varies from day to day, but today is a very good day.That's good then.I want you to witness the moment of someone's death.Bao can't handle that kind of blow.Stop crying.Why would you say something like that?Don't talk about death.Everyone dies eventually.Your face looks ugly when you cry. Go to the rooftop and dry your tears.Okay.You're so obedient.You're still in a relationship with Bao, right?For... 8... 8 years? It's a record-breaking relationship with a teacher.And recently, we got married.-What?! Married? -Hold on...Your reaction is too amazing. You should have told me!I wanted Bao to have permanent residency.Uh... huh?Permanent residency is useful in many ways, right?Uh, a fake marriage?I almost got arrested before for kidnapping a minor.This time, I might actually get sentenced.Is it true?It's true, really.But strictly speaking, even if it's fake, it's not entirely fake.Huh? What do you mean?I... really like Bao.He's gentle and cute.But it's just my one-sided crush on him.At least there's some interest from one side, so it's not entirely fake.Hmm... Is that so?And he says every day...- \"Mariko I love you.\" - He's good at pretending.But saying those thingsFor the sake of permanent residency, he's willing to say those things.it's a scumbag move.But even if it's a lie, it still brings me comfort.After all, no one has ever said that to me before.Are you worried about me?Uh... if the teacher thinks it's okay, then it's okay.It's okay. I really like Bao.So... I haven't slept with Bao.Huh?I haven't had sex with Bao,not even once.-Not even once? -Not even once.There were several opportunities, actually.But when I see his innocent and bright smile,I can't go through with it. If it was just for fun,maybe, but he's so sincere.I feel like it's not something I can do.I feel like I need to protect his smile.What are your feelings from that standpoint?But does Bao know about your feelings, teacher?Well, I think he knows.What are you doing, Bao? Sleeping with the teacher.-Yeah, we slept together. -Slept together.Is Bao having a cold?-It's nothing. -Take care of yourself.By the way, there's something I want to ask you.In Minamisoma...- Minamisoma? -A place you have a deep connection with.There's a movie theater called Asahi Cinema.- Asahi Theater? - Do you know about it?It's an old movie theater that's about to collapse.When I was transferred to Minamisoma, I used to go there all the time.One day, I watched a film called \"Toto the Hero,\" you know?Ah, directed by \"The Eighth Day\"?Yes, it's a gloomy film, but it has a fantastic ending.It's really good.But the double feature that was shown with it was \"The Mysterious Ghost Inn.\"It was the debut film by director Sugizuo Jitaro.It was good in its own way,but the two films didn't match at all, so I argued with that old man.old man?He was the beer-bellied manager.His selection of movies was a mess.That theater is a good one. When you have a long vacation,I hope you go help them rebuild it.I was actually saving moneyto buy the theater after I retired.I don't want that cinema to disappearbecause back then, when I watched movies there,it gave me the motivation to keep striving.People can live without movies,but there are many who were saved by those images.It would be too sad if such a place disappeared, don't you think?Later, the teacher seemed to improve a bit.I visit her when I have time and stay in Koriyama on weekends.I thought she might recover like that.When people are too close to each other, things turn out like this...Great movie.Last month, I went to Taiwan for the first time to buy the rights to a film.I just confirmed that it will be shown in a small theater in Tokyo.Can Bao understand it?He can't read many Chinese characters,but he can grasp the meaning.That's what makes a good movie.Hmm? What's the matter?You're very diligent.No, I just managed to buy this one.The first film Hamano managed to buy. I really want to watch it in a theater.Please come and watch it. It must be watched in a movie theater.Yes.Distribute all kinds of filmsand show them to people all over Japan. That's my dream.Although that dream didn't come true,I succeeded in turning a lost girl into a movie lover.Bao.Hamano, don't you have to work?You're asking the same question as the teacher. I took a special day off.I already got it all set up yesterday,with a bunch of pipes.I really like Mariko.- But Mariko... hates me. - Ah?I said I liked her, loved her.Every time I say it, she just smiles and brushes it off.But she actually hates me.That's not true. What are you talking about?The teacher really likes Bao.Maybe it's like... how should I put it...She likes me as if I were her son.Or maybe like a little dog or cat.Just say it's not true.Huh? So Bao married the teacher because he likes her?Of course. Why would he get married if he didn't like her?That's right. You're right.Actually, it doesn't matter to me.As long as Masako is with me, it doesn't matter if I don't have residency rights.But Mariko probably wants to...She wants to leave an inheritance for me.She's afraid that after she's gone,her father will take the money.Did you contact her father?She said it's not possible. She's very angry.She never used to get angry before.But Hamano, when you visit her,she's very happy.Mariko is gone.If I stay in Japan... it's meaningless.Marriage... is also meaningless.I don't want money.Bao!Please say something to her at the end.Teacher.Teacher, can you hear me?- Mariko. - Teacher!Teacher, Bao says he really likes you.Did you hear that? So, teacher, it's not unrequited love.Teacher, your marriage isn't fake either.Bao truly loves you, that's why he married you.Bao always says he likes you.But you never respond to him, which makes him very sad.So, teacher,Bao really likes you.Teacher?Really?Really, really.Bao!Mariko, I like you. I like you the most.So...Bao...Also likes me...It's mutual...We both like each other...Yes, yes, it's mutual, teacher.What the...?What the...?So that's how it is...If I had known earlier...Mariko?At 8:24 in the evening, she left.Mariko!Teacher!Her last words...Last words...?She said, \"If I had known earlier,I would have done it,\" right?Isn't that what she said?Well, it could be expressed differently... not like \"done it\"...What kind of final words are those?What kind of Last words!Say something nicer!It's rare to hear... such final words.Very unique.Indeed.In the end, I accomplished nothing, just caused trouble.But I'm still happy about it.- Old man. - Oh.Forget it.What's the matter? Say it.Do you still think that in the end, blood ties are the most important?I don't know. My wife left me, and I don't have any children.My younger brother also went ahead. Sooner or later, I'll die alone.I guess there's no way around it.In the past, my family had good relationships.A typical middle-class family, you could say.If it weren't for the disaster, we would probably still get along well.I would have lived carefree.Then, I might have thought that family is the most important.In the end, family blood is thicker than waterBut the disaster happened, it just had to happen.There's no going back to how things were before it happened.So... since the earthquake.I stopped believing in family bonds.Aunt Hideko said at that time,\"Even if locals know that family is an illusion,they still find solace in it.\"Although I felt that might be true,if it's an illusion,the despair of seeing through the illusion is immeasurable.so…Rather than finding solace in an illusion,I want to build a community that doesn't require illusions.I think that ideal has more hope.I completely agree with that statement.So, I initially thought of using the cinema to achieve it.But my approach was wrong.Instead of desperately trying to preserve the cinema for dignity's sake,I should have thought about how to incorporate the cinema into a new building.That way it wouldn't be so boring.Without a cinema like this,people would think that cinemas always exist, so they don't cherish them.It's the same everywhere. People only feel regret when something is about to be demolishedIt's better than nobody feeling regret, right?That's true.It's the same with people. You can't always see the person you love.You never know when they'll disappear. Nobody can predict it.It's hard to understand this kind of thing, no matter how many failures you have.\"Write it down as a reflection on life!\"Sigh. Can the construction suddenly stop miraculously?Just like in the movies.We say things like that, and then it actually happens...Let's go grab a meal.Sure.what's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry? It'll shorten your lifespan, you know.No, I can't die yet!Hey! Hey!The construction has been canceled!-Oh? -Halted! It's been halted!What's going on?Here's what happened...It's just... you see...It didn't convey the meaning properly.Did you manage to raise the money?I can't believe you... Oh!?And what about this place...?No problem anymore.That's great.Sadao has been negotiating with the other party persistently.-Ah sada! -No, no, no...I came up with an idea.Even if we don't demolish this place, there are still other lands.So I introduced them to some cheap vacant lots.But if they couldn't come up with the money, it wouldn't work.But the townspeople donated money to us.Hideko donated a large sum, and together with the public, it's 4.5 million.The rest... Oh? Ah, over there! Come on!Bao! ?- Long time no see. - Why are you here?I saw the news and recognized your face on Instagram.But the name wasn't quite right...But the last two characters were the same as Mariko's.So I immediately understood.\"Mariko\" was the first Chinese character I learned.This person donated 5 million.Mariko's gift to me.I'm going back to Vietnam to open a cinema.That will require money.It's okay, there's still some left. I'll work hard.I'll probably only be able to build a small cinema.That's amazing.And also,I need to ask you a favor.I've placed Mariko's ashes in a temple.Mariko said she wanted them scattered in the sea.When I return after opening the cinema in my country, I'll come back again.Please protect her remains for me.I understand. I promise you.Bao, thank you.Bao, may I borrow her photo to see?Of course.Oh? Who is this person...?Teacher Mariko Tanaka.Bao's wife and my mentor.She taught in Minamisoma, so she also came here.Ah I see!The one who complained about our double feature being awful!Old man, this combination just doesn't work.Nagging. A good movie is a good combination.Emotions will cancel each other out, like mixing seafood with hamburgers.It'll upset your stomach. You just don't get it.It's called a dream match, like a wrestling match between Antonio Inoki and Muhammad Ali.It only feels like a dream when it doesn't happen.Didn't we learn a lesson from the mess between Inoki and Ali?Last month, we had \"Eternal Day\" paired with \"Peking Man.\"What mood do you expect me to go home with?I liked both of them. Why don't you pair them?Fine, old man, listen carefully.If it were me, I'd do it like this.I'd try out her combination and see how it plays out. And the audience lined up for miles.I wanted to ask her again, but she never came back.That was probably when she was transferred to Koriyama.The expressions of the audience leaving were completely different—filled with satisfaction.Everyone looked confused when I finished setting it up.How did you manage to set it up?Oh, so it was her...Bao, thank you.But what about the remaining amount?The other party told me not to reveal their identity under any circumstances.It's Hinano Asahi Transportation Company.Thank you so much...Really?Anyway, it's a cause for celebration.That's great!Thank you, everyone.- That's great! - Yes!- That's great, isn't it? - Thank you, everyone...Are you leaving tomorrow?Hey.Hey.Oh, what's up?Um...Thank you for the money.I'll repay you in the future.No need to repay. I didn't do it as a father.You can't do that.My mom and I went to that theater when we were traveling before.ah?We drove by there.Mom said it's rare to pass by, so let's watch a movie.The ticket usher was a man.So I have a vivid impression.He said it was a horror movie, perfect for a couple on a date.- General Manager - I'll be right there.Goodbye, Asahi. Take care.Is it really okay? The general manager is driving himself.The situation is critical now.If there are no passengers, we have to do everything from cargo to errands.- After the storm comes the calm. Let's go! - Okay.Thank you all so much.- Keep up the good work. - Thanks, boss.Thank you, Chairman. You helped me a lot.The real test has just begun.Bao,thank you so much.Goodbye.- See you another day. - Thank you.- Keep up the good work. - Thank you.Let's go eat.Old man.I've decided to stay here.Aren't you going back to Tokyo?Preserving the Asahi Theater doesn't mean a perfect ending.Yeah.And if I leave, won't you feel lonely? Stop pretending!Who would feel lonely? I have full control over the movie lineup. It's paradise.In the end, that's why you failed.But...not everything can be judged as right or wrong.- About the large bathhouse? - Yes.That person from Company Iwas also trying to do the right thing for the town and its residentsYeah.I don't know if this result is really considered good.All we can do is work hard from now on so as not to let this day down.Yeah.We can only manage the theater like growing good rice.We'll definitely encounter failures as well.Sometimes you say something sensible.Old man, your days are numbered, but I still have a bright future.You should really change your habit of being sarcastic.What do you want to eat?What should we eat?Teacher, how are you doing over there?We went through some hardships here, and this is the result.- What are you doing? Take a look over there.- What?Even without psychic abilities, I can tell.He's filled with an ominous aura as if he's about to die.Seems suspicious.Do you want to play a scene?- A scene? - To stop him from committing suicide.The plot is that you stole money from a guest.- What a rotten person. - Don't you want to act?Of course I do. It sounds interesting.If I'm just overthinking, that's fine too. I'll go to the projection room.What about the character setting?Just play yourself.Play myself?Play yourself, huh...Maybe one day, someone will be saved here by a phantom image.Even if it's just one person, I want to hold on until that day comes.A brooding yet kind-hearted film enthusiast,moved to tears despite the darkness."}

They are all there.Eternity captured in death.Follow me.I'II show you the BodyWerks studio.Huh?Put down your backpack.Kanako, show her around.It's 2A-1.Follow me.\n\n\nWe scan each body, as you've seen.Next we install a bolt into the most appropriate point.Then we drain blood from each body for embalming.Finally, we are ready for plastination.Plastination?We pose each body in a particular positionand inject synthetic resin for solidification.Every BodyWerk is different.Head tilt, hand angle and the gaze.Each host leaves traces of their lives.Ema is a genius.She can breathe life intoa body with her plastination.What a weird expressionto describe the dead, though.A special ritual only Ema can do.Come back tomorrow if you are serious.Ready?- Here's the list for today.- Thanks.Good morning, Ma'am.I wanted to thank you for...Speak with action, not with words.That's our rule.Was it your father's wish?He had a weird religious beliefand didn't want to be cremated.It was his last wishso I want to respect it.He's what's calledan alligator snapping turtle.It's my husbandwho passed away recently.Can you preserve the brain and organs?Exactly what kind of posingdo you prefer?He didn't tell us.What's popular now?I want him to sit in front of his pianoas if he's playing.With his fingers on each key.She's cuter when she opens her mouth.I want her to pose like this, see?Can you make me look younger again?I don't want to look old when I die.I've had this fascinationwith mummified kings and monks.I feel like I found something thatsurpasses them.I understand I'll never get him back.But there are momentsI feel he might come back.And so.This...I fully understand...He's not coming back.Ready?Watch me carefully.Cleanse the body with a sponge.Spray antiseptic solutionon the gauze...and wipe.Let the liquid seep into every pore.Your turn.You won't like the feel at first.Kinda like that.Don't touch with your bare hands!Always wear gloveswhen you touch the body, got it?Not hungry.Our job is much more demandingmentally and physically than you imagine.Do me a favor and eat.What is this crapIt's good once you get used to it.But it gets even better with this.How is it?What is it?Not bad, huh?Goodbye.Study Leonardo da Vinci'sdrawings carefully. Ema.Your mirror neurons are interfering.Your nerve cells resonatewith the corpse in front of you.You'll get used to it.Bodies are just objects.Why do you thinkpeople yearn for plastination?Resistance.Resistance?Resistance to death.However...by treating dead bodiesthoroughly as objects,you can liberate yourselffrom the fear of death.The moment you are able to do that,quite unexpectedly...transcendental beauty will beginto reveal itself.There'll come a timewhen you will understand.This hand is very eloquent.Whoever it is,the artist is talented.How would you know that?Ema sees BodyWerks as a wayto overcome death for humans.But one day,I'll think of a different wayto overcome death.Like how?In a way...I want to make time stopwhile we're stiil alive.As if we're riding a space shuttleat the speed of light.Are you going to be an astronaut?There you are, Amane.What happened?The boy told mehe wants to be an astronaut.He is Ema's younger brother.He's likely to inheritEternity in the future.They are here.Please have a seat over there.You stay here.We truly appreciate this.I have read your files.About your child, yes?Here's a photo.It's the image of our boy in her belly.You'll have to leave him with us.You'll be okay?If I could...I would put him back into my belly.I don't want to lose him ever again.I want to keep him near me forever.Please help us.Please.Excuse me.These are the filesfor today's interview.I'll put it right here.I want you to handle that couple.Are you going to or not?I will.One more thing.Stay away from Amane.Understood.I...loved touching things.I used to believetouching things was a wayto know the shapes of thingsor people's feelings.When I held him for the first time,he felt so small and fragile.I expected this feeling would turn...into something else.Something like love gushing out of me.But...that emotion just didn't come.He was right in front of me.This scrunched-up,vulnerable,and tiny creature.I was supposed to keep him alive.All by myself.The factjust horrified me.You...You don't own your baby.And the baby...He doesn't own you.Live your own life.Don't get trapped.Now I see how little I understood Ema.It was the next morning that I learnedshe had been removed from her post.Here are your visitor badges.Pin them on so we can see.Everyone has fun at BodyWerks!Here is our studio.This is where we do plastination.Plastination is a technology wherebody fluids and fats from the deadare replaced with plastic resin.Our advancements in this evolutionary technologyhave made BodyWerks a global brand.Here she comes.Welcome.30 years oldRina, a minute please.Any last questions about plastination?I have one.Go ahead.Are you trying to rebuild human bodiesinto something immortal?Actually, such rumorshave been around a long time.And maybe it's becausethat's what we allsecretly wish for, no?What would you do?That's the point.You make the choice.Long time no see.You do look like you've beenon a space shuttle and back.How many bodiesdo you work on per day?About 20.Quite a lot.We have more people working here now.I only handle a few.You confront dead bodiesevery dayto stop their death foreverbefore they start to decay.But it also stops time for those who are living.The first victim is Ema.Butthis technology will be vitalfor my research on anti-aging.Has Ema agreed to your idea?I'll come back again.Breaking news.Cosmetics giant Eternitythat conducts research ontelomeric initialization technologyhas been authorized its applicationon humans by the Ministry of Health.The technology is expected toinhibit the aging processthereby offering the prospect ofimmortality to humankind.Now a word from Amane.As reported by the media,my 5-year research on anti-agingat Max Planck Institute isnear its completion.Here's my argument.Living organisms are net meant to die.Certain types of jellyfish and protozoadon't even have life-spans.Death has become unnecessary.This paradigm shift will take timebut as our-name Eternity...Don't flatter yourself, Amane!What you're trying to achieveis not evolution.It's devolution.Immortalityis against our father's ideals.You'll have to leave.She's fine. Ema?Let's get out.Please excuse us.I'll leave it to you.Sure.Shall we resume?Mr. Sasaki?Who is she?Someone who I used to love.I've been working on herfor 20 yearsand I've only got this far.It's daunting.In the end, a corpse is just a corpse.Listen.Death is not the opposite of life.Deathis a part of life.A survey conducted bythe Ministry of Health has revealedover 90% of the publicwish to receive anti-aging treatment.However, with its current capacityEternity can only accept0.8% of the applicants.There is public outcry abouthow the lines are drawn.No to the anti-aging!It's her.We know your tactics.Anti-aging isn't for us poor, right?It won't bring happiness to humankind.You'll pay the price.Tell the witch what it is.Over here!Have a seat.The first-aid kit...is here.Anti-aging technology.How real is it?It's already real.But strangely,people seem more afraid ofimmortality than death.You may be right.Unlike our executivesI have no fear of risks.Whether they be religious or scientific.Rather...Rather?The completion of this technology willdivide humankind into two groups.Those who get to board the shipand those who don't.I want you to come on board with me.Are you taking Rina with you?Ema...Do you remember when Mom died?Dad wouldn't let anybodytouch her remains.Day after day,he would weep over her corpseeven though she started to decay.There was nothing we could do for him.Seeing Dad's reaction got you...fixated on plastination, right?But disguising death as life is wrong.I just wanted to live with youand share the same moments.Ema...with you.Why are you looking at me so sadly?I won't get on your ship.But that's my decision.You have no need to feel guilt.Not even a bit.Few hours remain until the New Year.This year has beena milestone for BodyWerks.Its value has surpassedthe beauty of its artworkbut is now a vital technology forachieving the beauty of eternal youth.Have you seen Kanako?No.Okay. Thanks.Good to see you, Rina.Hello.I love this work.The red is perfect.Thank you. Enjoy the party.Thank you.Let's make a toast to...our beautiful and brave ladywho is leading us in this evolution.To our great artist Rina!And to our eternal youth!Cheers!Rina.How are you feeling? Better now?Much better.Are you really going to leave?That's what I'm thinking.I couldn't have comethis far if it wasn't for you.I'm not strong enough to live like Ema.I don't think you are too, Rina.I must be going.Sorry Nana.So sorry.The New Year is about to start.Still working?You are, too.Care for a drink?If you're having one.What do we make a toast to?To my son.It's his birthday.He should be 13.What's his name?I don't know.I abandoned my own sonbefore I even named him.Will you marry me, Rina?Come on board with me.Tell me.Do you want to have kids?That would be nice but...I honestly don't know right now.I can never let myselfmake the same mistake.Couldn't we overcomethat mistake together?I don't want to keep you waitingwhile I find the answer to that.I'll be waiting.Even if it takes forever.I know you refused his offer.But you deserve to bethe first beneficiaryof this technology.I am...I'm sick and tired of living shackledto this body.I am free.I won't let myself get trapped.Dear Ema,I was 19 years oldwhen I started working for you.A t the time I was helplessly ignorantand helplessly hopeless about life.But after I met you,I was able to learn a lot by facing death.You told me thatif I could treat dead bodies as objectstranscendental beautywill begin to reveal itself.But gradually since thenI've come to realize the beautyof living in the momentand want to live itto its fullest potential.I have chosento take the next step forwardinto a new humankind.Not with my words, but with my actions.Farewell, Ema.We are now entering an erain which we overcome aging and death.Living hundreds of yearswith eternal beauty of youth.\"Till death do us apart.\"This line will soon disappearfrom wedding vows.You don't have to hurry.We'll have all the time in the world.For years we've beenimproving piastination,which replaces blood and fatwith synthetic resin.We now have a new technologyof injectingtelomeric initializing cellsinstead of resin.Think of them ascontrollable cancer cells.They will continue to divide,indefinitely, safely, and stably.The plastination technologyenables the circulation ofnew cells and the existing cellsin the human bodyto prevent its aging process.Please look at the document...Excuse me.Death gives life meaningbecause it is inevitable for humans.Without death,will we find meaning in life?As to your question...That will be...corrected as \"for humans in the past.\"The idea that death gives life meaningwas designed to console humanswithout a choice of immortality.It was just anti-immortality propaganda.I will prove this true with my life.I hope that answered your question.89 years oldI'm home.Good morning.Nana. You're up already.Is she asleep?Yes.There.Thank you.Just this morningToki passed away.I'm sorry.Toki...She passed on very peacefully.Just like Kanako.It's good to hear that.It's your day off.Would you like something to eat?No thanks. I'll get some sleep.Thanks as always.My pleasure.32 years oldOn this islandI want to build a placefor those who didn't get on board the ship.Whether it was their choice or not.People like Ema.That's a wonderful idea. It really is.That's a wonderful idea. ‘It really is.Sleepyhead!Sorry.Melos, come this way.Where's your mouth?Haru, it's lunchtime.Wash yowr hands.Yes!There you go!50 years oldRina, are you ready?In a minute.Thanks for waiting.Let's get going.Goocl mowing.Good morning.Bon appétit!I got some bad news.I apparently havea special kind of genetic abnormality.What does that mean?It means it's interfering withmy anti-aging treatment.There's more.The aging rate of my cellshas suddenly accelerated.In my estimation,the time I have left is...2 months.That's all we can disclose for now.Bring in Amane!Give us answers!Where is he?Do you expectany more similar cases?We don't know for sureat this moment.

That was a surprise.I would say 100% of my acquaintances.My mother did not receive the operation.But I did.I still have an occasional tingeof regret.How desperate I want to live.But I couldn't havepaid the 250-year loan either.Maybe it was better this way.Everyone here went throughsimilar life experiences.This island is almost exclusively forthe Old Generation.I don't spend much timethinking about death for now.I'm keeping my optimistic view of life.Will you tell uswhy you chose this facility?My wife Fumi was diagnosedwith terminal cancer.We wanted to spend our remaining timepeacefully in a place like this.You can be rest assured.We'll do everything we can for you.Actually my late motherspent her last days here.Well...Is there any reason why you did notreceive an anti-aging treatment, Rihito?Was it genetic abnormality like Fumi?No. I chose not to.Do I need a reason for that?Not at all. I'm sorry.Do you have other family members?We have no childrenso it's just the two of us.I see.Amane's GardenI don't eat any foreign food.Like cheese, for example.If I can choose what I eat..Toki's keepsakesfor anybody to take.Please take it if you like it.See?You can have it.Thank you.A clockwork toy.- What is yourname?- Haru.Haru...

Rina.Draw some pictures.Draw what?Your mom.I'm not good at drawing peopleHow about a house?Okay.Let me see...You're good.Am I?Everyone has fun at BodyWerks!We detect no problems whatsoever.The genetic concern on Amane's spermhas had no effect on Haru.Which means heranti-aging treatment wiill work?Sure.You need to come here regularlyfor check-ups, though.That's a relief.This was your answerto Amane, right?Giving birth to Haru.My answer?I don't know.RinaWhen I look at Haru,there are moments whenI can feel Amane's presense.Her fingertips...her hairline...or the particular angle of her mouthwhen she smiles.Amane's passing was a huge loss.Gene abnormalities are now treatable.Even the age 40 limit would be...Can I ask you something?About people over 40being eligible for treatment.Are we in the clinical phase already?If somay I recommend someone for your list?A resident from your facility?Rina, of all people,you should understand.But...Even if it was possible for the elderlyto become immortal,it would be a difficult worldfor them to adapt to.Is it impossible?Anti-aging treatment technologyis not just about Eternity or us.Even if...we're talking about my son?There they are.Don't be scared.I'm here...to ask you something.Was it because of me that you decidednot to have the anti-aging treatment?It had no meaning to me.That's all.Tell me the truth.That's how I wanted it.It has nothing to do with you.It might not be too late.I'm sure Fumidoesn't want you to die if you can live.I know I don't.So could you please think it over?You don't understand anything.Will you leave?I never thought you hadn't hadthe anti-aging treatment.I never imaginedyou could die before me.We're done here.Now go.- But...- Get out!Melos?Melos?Haru?I've always wanted to come here.Thanks for bringing me.My pleasure.I love the scenery from here too.When I'm here...I feel like I've been left alonein this world.Only humans have eternal lives.Everything else in naturehas a beginning and an end.It's as if we've been left out.It makes me wonderwhether we have evolved or devolved.I know somebody whosaid something like that.Rina!Haru's missing.Haru.Haru.Where is she?Nana, you go that way.Have you seen Haru?No.Thank you.What should we do?Let's go down to the port.What if something's happened to her?It'll be all right. We'll find her.She isn't reckless.She probably wanted me to fix Melos.I can't thank you enough.I didn't do anything.She was putting on a brave facewhen I found her walking.Can you take her home?Of course.I met you once.When I visited BodyWerkson a school trip.For an instant, our eyes met.But you didn't recognize me.I kept on waiting for you.\"My mother will come back for me.\"But...you didn't come back when Grandma died.And then Grandpa died.Finally...I realised what a fool I've been.Then I met someone.It was Fumi.That's whenI was truly born into this world.At lastI got my life back.It's your turn now. Live your own life...Mother.Around here.Okay? Here goes.Thank you.- Can I close it?- Sure.Let's say a prayer.Thank you, Melos, xIt's fun!Are you okay?Rihito's coming.Fumi, are you all right?Let me prop you up on some pillows, Fumi.Fumi?You'll be all right.It's all right.You'll be all right.All right.Rihito.Please get some rest.I'll take care of her.You'll be all right.Happy birthday.When I'm born again...promise meyou willfind me.In less than 2 months,Fumi passed a way.Six months later,Rihito went out to sea by himselfand never came back.Seri, come over here and help me!Okay.135 years oldYou're late.Sorry.Haru,can I have some tea?-\tSeri, pour some tea for Rina.-\tSure.Have you decidedthe subject for your paper?My subject was always going to beabout my Grandma Rina's life.-\tThere you go.-\tThank you.Uncle Rihito's camera was not broken.The film inside was fine too.- Really?- What were on them?That's a secret.I still thinkit's wrong to choose deathwhen you can live forever.Don't you agree, Mom?My time will come.I didn't accomplish everythingI wanted to do.I didn't see all that there is t® see.I didn't learn all that there is to know.ButI'll die with more experiencethan anybody could wish f®r.That's how my life will be an arcwith a beginning and an end.Sothe first woman to havethe chance to live forever,will also be the first to give that up.You're right.Seri, hurry up!Wait up!What's the matter, Haru?I stilldon't want you to die, Rina.Death gives meaning to life.It's a myth fabricatedby the ancient people.Even if that's so...it's a myth...that I believe in.Let's go.Ready?Grandma's, here.Rina!Coming to get you!Guys, over there!YOSHINE KyokoTERAJIMA ShinobuOKADA MasakiBAISHO ChiekoFURUKI JunKOBAYASHI KaoruDirected by ISHIKAWA KeiWritten byISHIKAWA Kei and SAWAI KaeriMusic by SEIBU HirokoA BANDAI NAMCO ArtsProductionSubtitles by USUI NaoyukiSubtitles Produced by AURA"}

I'm here.Are you hungry, darling?I'm fine. Don't worry about me.Now that you have come back to life,and you have come back home.What do you want to do?I haven't come back to life.I'm not going to come back to life.Why don't we have dinnersomewhere nice tonight?I'd love to... but I have a friend to visit.So soon?Why wait?Hey...... you never wrote to me from Thailandlike what you said you would.No time to buy stamps.Hello, darling!Hello honey. Are you still jogging?Yes, I'm still here but I'm going back soon.Listen, I'm cooking some Thai food tonight.You're going to cook?- You'd like that?- Great!- Anyway, see you at home. Bye.- Okay.

I promise.Stop.Kyoji...Don't you trust me?Of course not.Oh well...... then why don't you stir the soup for me?Okay?Smells good, doesn't it.- Listen, why don't you have some cigars?- No.Just stay there.Did you enjoy your vacation?Don't try to be funny.So you've come to kill me?Yes.Why didn't you stay away?Why do you want to start up trouble again?Because you must be punished.You know, I like you.You were quite a fine cook.You are also a pretty good chef.But you are an evil man.Evil?Pretty harsh word.You didn't have to kill me.It was bad enough thatyou hired me to kill your wife.But you also betrayed me.Betrayed you?As far as I remember...... you were the one who wasfucking my wife behind my back...... for months.And now you come to meand talk about betrayal?You could have just killed mefor having the affair.That, I would understand.But I murdered someone!Because of you!Murder!Okay, calm down.We had a deal.Yes, we did.And then you broke the deal.I didn't know I was going to be killed.Well... it's cause and effect.You do something bad and thensomething bad happens to you in return.Simple as that.Exactly.And that is why I am here tonight.I'm the something badthat's gonna happen to you now.Hey, cigar?No.Well?It's fine.It's great.It's pretty good.I am in love.That's why I've been so happy lately.I'm not the type of personwho's afraid of death...... but right now...... I really want to enjoymy new happiness...... with my girl.That's for Noi?Oh, yes.You know her too.You're going to ask her to marry you?Tonight.Are you going to shoot me with that gun?It's gonna be messy.No, I've brought something else.That's better.Very appropriate for a chef.It's the same bottle I used to kill Seiko.You sure you don't want some wine?No.You know, we don't have to do this.All can be forgotten and all can be happy.I can never be happy again.Well, I'm sorry to hear that.Hey, darling, come here!I can't.Come on!No, really I can't. You stay inside.Nid just said something...Oh my god!You!Hello Noi.Well, I guess there's no needfor introduction.What are you doing here?Kyoji just came over to help usmake some soup. Right?With that gun?Why are you doing this?Does she know?Not everything.What?What is that?It's for you.You got that for me?Yes.But you're not supposedto see it until after dessert.It's beautiful.What's going on?Is this some kind of joke?Yes, it's a joke.It's not funny.I'm sorry.I have a weird sense of humor.Would you like some wine now?Oh sure.Honey, would you pour ussome wine, please?Maybe we can see yousome other time soon.Some other time.Do you have stamps?Stamps?Hello, old friend.I was waiting for you.To tell you the truth,I'm really lazy tonight.Not in the moodfor this sort of thing at all.How about karaoke?That's exactly what I was doing...... when the boss called.You are very loyal.That is one thing I'm proud of.Good for you.I have nothing to be proud of yet.You plan to go back home and sleep?And tomorrow start a new life?Not exactly.I'm just going to take a walk.There is no home to go back to.You know this walkhas to end sometime, right?I know.And it will end soon.Yes.But will you let it end?Yes.How many timeshave you crossed this water?A lot.Will you miss it?I guess either I will find out now...... or else I'll never know.You sorry you didn't get your revenge?I realized I have nothing to get revenge for.No one really hurt me.Not even the boss?No...... he just didn't let me knowcertain things...... that I should have known myself.You could have killed him tonight.Sure, I could've.I wanted to.Why didn't you?He seemed so happy. Very happy.That's your reason for not getting revenge?Who do you think deserves to live more?A happy man...... or a homeless ghost?I see.In a way, I envy you.About what?I always wonder what the end will be like.You're about to know.You think it really matters?Yes, it does...... but I'm in no rush to be sure.Right.It's getting late.I don't want to keep you.It's my pleasure.But...... I guess it's gotta end sometime.Any last words?Could you mail this postcard for me?I'll leave it right here.No problem.Have you put a stamp on it?It helps."}

Oh, to the manager.Oh my, so that's how it is.Really, I didn't expect that.It's nothing like that.Hi, this is from Aki. Yes, I'll pass to him right away.It's your friend Kikuta.- Today is Saturday, right?- Yes.She always disappears every Saturday.What?She doesn't say where andwho she's going with,and the people at the bardon't seem to know either.My guess is that she'swith that guy.What guy?You know, the punk who spilled drinks on you, that trade journal guy.Oh, that kept man?No way!But I wonder how old is she?Why do you ask?Huh? No reason...Could she be married?I have no idea.She said she wasn't married.Why do you ask?Let's drink a lot tonight!Are you disappointed becauseyou didn't get a girl?It's not that at all.

Who's the smug one here?Mr. Kamiya...Please, stop.No. I won't let this guymake light of me.What's wrong, Kaneko?What seems to be the matter?Who are you?- Please, stop, you just go home.- Just go home?- Why the hell should we leave?- Who are you guys?What do you want?You should mind your mouth!- Mr. Kamiya...- We won't let you pick on our friend.That does it!- Hey, let's go outside.- It'll be our pleasure.- Right?- Yeah.Hey!Let's stop this...- What are you doing, Kaneko?- Let's stop here.- Let's go. Let's go.- Don't act so high-and-mighty.- Never mind this.- Are you hurt?No, I'm all right.You are disturbing my business.Leave.- We're just drinking.- That's what he said.- We're sorry!- You boys are helpless.I'm so sorry about this ruckus!- Did something serious happen?- It was nothing.Please, enjoy your stay!Where's Mr. Kamiya?- Mr. Kamiya just left.- Is that so?- Oh, welcome.- Welcome!- Welcome back.- Thanks.- Welcome back.- Thank you.Mr. Kamiya!Have you come for business here?No, I came for you.Me?Thank you for coming all this way.Where have you been?I was waiting here for a while.You see, I went for some drinks around that area.I came to apologize.You don't have to.It was nothing.Shall we take a walk outside?Let me change clothes.Who in the world is that man?What's his relationship with you?It's nothing special...I have seen him and a womanstay together in a hotel.I happened to see itby coincidence.He's a playboy.I have nothing to do with him now.What do you mean?Lots of things happen inthis line of business.I only took pity on him because he was all alone.But he just took advantage of me.So, you two...?We were both drunk so I didn't realizeit, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.You must have been lonely.I'd say so.Lonely enough for such a manto take advantage of you.Now, I understand.Miss Akiko?Despite your job, you'rea pure-hearted person.I see that now.I think I understand what kind of person you are.You really are a lonely person.I want to do anything withinmy power for you.If there's anything I could do,I'd really love to...Just a moment...What's wrong?Put your hand out, please.What's this?Clench your fists.What are these?These stones hide at the bottom of the river during high tide.And they show themselvesat low tide.During that time,the water was ebbed like this.So... This is from the atomic bomb?Yes.There are plenty of stoneslike these in Hiroshima.These are the stones of Hiroshima.Why did you give these stones to me?Please, make yourself at home.If you need me during the night,please ring the bell over there.It's quiet here, so we can talk.Why are you so interested in me?Huh?Because I like you. There's noother reason aside from that.Have a seat.Do you want to drink?Are you suspectingmy intentions?I guess it can't be helped,considering my job.You think that all menare the same, right?Not at all.Not at all?What does that mean?I... really lo...Do you hate me?I'm sure you know how I feel.However...- However?- I'm sure you'll regret it later.I won't regret it.That's not going to happen.Hold on, there are still things you don't know about me.- That's not a problem.- No, wait...Hold on a second.Open the door.I was a schoolgirl at that time.When the atomic bomb hit,I was outside Hiroshima whilebeing mobilized for labor services.Since then, worried of the changes that might happen inside my body,I lived in fear until today.I believed that I wasn't allowed to know a woman's happiness anymore.After I graduated, my parents died,and I started working at a company.I also worked as a housekeeper.And, somehow, I ended updoing this job.Of course, there were temptations.I'm also a woman, after all.So, wanting to rely on a man makes sense.But my body won't allow me.Every time men see my body, theyrun away. Of course they get scared.Now, you know whatkind of woman I am.I'm just like those Hiroshimastones from earlier.Because of the reflection of thebright blue sky during the day,and the pretty neon lights at night, thestill pebbles at the bottom of this riverjust seem to go unnoticedby everyone.Do you understand it now?Well, then.Where are you going?I'm going home.Goodbye.Don't go!You can't go home.- Let me go.- Don't leave, I won't let you.No...It doesn't matter how your body lookslike. My feelings won't change.- I love you, after all.- You're lying.You're not being honestwith yourself.Live together with me.I'll support you no matter what.- I will heal your illness!- No.You can't...I don't believe it.I just can't believe it.You can't believe me?It's not you personally, but I...Miss Akiko!Let's get married.Huh?We can't... Knowing that youlove me is good enough.Don't say that.You have to stay strong.I want to help you.You'll regret what you just said.Stay strong.I want to make you happy.I'm sure I can do it.- I'm sure you'll regret it.- No...I'll love you until death.Your unhappiness is my unhappiness.And your happiness ismy own happiness!Come to Tokyo with me tonight.That's the best option.Do you think you can come?I won't leave you nomatter what happens.If you are sick and dying,use my love as a stepping stoneto live for as long as you can.I will gladly be yourstepping stone.Will you come with me?Will you?Thank you. Then, I'll wait for you at thestation. I'll buy your ticket as well.You must come, all right?Yes.Marriage, huh?I think you're well awareon what that means.Yes. That's why I'm here to consult you.About that... I can't forbid you.And if I were to say something,it would be what I always tell you about your health.That you never know howit's going to be affected.Well, I won't dare oppose,since it concerns your happiness.But I'm concerned about a sudden increase in white blood cells.However...this is your happiness we're talkingabout, so I can't say anything as a doctor.Mr. Kamiya...Sorry I made you wait.I'm glad.I thought you wouldn't come.Excuse me.One entrance ticket.What?I've already bought your ticket.Yes...- And your luggage?- I don't have it.You didn't bring any?Let's go now.Miss Akiko! Miss Akiko!What's wrong with you?You see, I'll say goodbye here.Why is that?I can't go with you, after all.We still have time.Let's go somewhere and talk.Are you still worried about yourhealth? I told you I'll...It's not that.Why did you suddenlychange your mind?Let me think more seriouslyabout this.I need more time to think.Time to think?You'll be fine if you come with me.I feel like this memoryis enough for me.I was very happy.At any rate, let's sayour farewells today.No way.I'll never leave you.I won't give up.If you're not coming now, please get readyand wait until I come back for you.I'll definitely come and get you.I can't extend my stay any longer, but I will come back for you another day.I mean it.I promise you.All right, see you next time.Goodbye.- Oh, Kamiya!- Yes?Do you have the data onthe coal mine turnover?I haven't got that yet.Give me some more time.- I'm counting on you, then.- Yes.To Akiko Hayashima, Hiroshima CityReturned LetterMr. Kikuta, you have a phone call.- All right, take this.- Okay.Hello? This is Kikuta.Oh, it's you, Kamiya?How are you doing?Are you well?It's the same as always for me.What? Bar?Which one?Yeah...Oh, bar Aki?What? The manager?Apparently, she hasn't beenat the bar lately.I think she went toplay somewhere.I really haven't seen her lately.You stay well, okay?Let's meet at a later date.What? Look for her? Don't kid me!I'm busy, so I can't do such a thing.I told you I'm busy!Why don't you come over hereif you're that worried?Hello!Welcome!Welcome.There is an empty seat in the back.You can go there.It's okay, here's fine.- Long time no see, sir.- Indeed.- This was the bottle, right?- Yes.- Welcome!- Hey!What a rare visit!When did you arrive?Just a moment ago.Really now?Say, manager, he's Mr. Kamiya, a reporterfor the Weekly Journal in Tokyo.- Is that so? Nice to meet you.- Likewise.Then, does this means Akiko quit?She passed away.Huh? When?Two months ago.You didn't know?Two months ago?It was so sudden...What a pity.That's right.But she put up with her illnessuntil the very end.I didn't notice that she was ill.She was such a nice person.Oh, owner, are yousure you're all right?I'm all right.I was resting for a bit.Sorry about that.So, you really didn't know about it?When did her condition turn bad?Who knows? We didn't really like to talk about our illnesses.And it's not like we could doanything about it either.Trying to forget about itwas the best we could do.I never expected herto collapse like that.Was it in a hospital?No, she collapsed in the hallway in herapartment as she was going to work.She should have rested more instead of pushing herself so hard.By the time I arrived aftera neighbor called me,she couldn't say a word anymore.We promised each other when one of us dies, the other will send them off by themselves.So, only me and a neighborheld a modest vigil.What a lonely funeral it was.Actually, thinking about it, I believethat's exactly what Aiko had wanted.In her last past months here, as she was reading your letters,she never looked happier to me.I should have comefor her sooner...No, I believe Akiko intendedto never see you again.Why?Why is that?Because if she had done that,she would've relied on you andeven leave to Tokyo with you.To Akiko, the last night you spent together in Hiroshima was everything to her.She ended up spending all her life force on that single day.Every other day after that,she lived like it was her last.People like us live constrictedby our condition.For us, who live anddie in a corner,to be able to meet a singleperson to give our hearts to,seems like a forbidden dream.Even if we were just a pastimefor the other party,that doesn't make ourhappiness less genuine.That's what I think.Please, rest in peace,for the error shall not be repeatedA NIGHT TO REMEMBERTHE END"}

Lost and afraid.As you all should be.But your presence in this room is a signof your undying loyalty to your leader.Which is more than I can say for black mantaor gorilla Grodd and captain cold.They're the most pathetic of all.Too scared to even show up.Yes, yes, yes. It was the recklessnessof captain cold that caused your near demise.Luthor:Never mind them!I have a new ally and most powerful servant.Time trapper, bow to them.Time trapper:Time shall mend all slights.He's scary and strange. Me like him.Ls he your, ha, ha, plaything?I will use time trapper's powersto destroy the Justice League once and for all.Before they even began.Dawnstar: And that's the whole story.-What she said.Fascinating.Just when we believe Lex Luthor dead,he returns, not from Hades but from the future.Imagine what the power of time travelcould do in that maniac's hands.I'd really rather not. Lex has to be stopped.Superman [Over comm]:Justice League, we have to move now.[Comm beeps][Comm beeps]These were all \"hold the pickles,\" right?Now is the hour.Time trapper, I now command youto open a portal to a certain cornfield......in Smallville, Kansas, some years ago.Time trapper: As the sands of time runthy will shall be donelegion of doom, you will go into the past......and keep the baby Kal-Elfrom ever falling into the hands......of those sickeningly sweet rubes,Martha and Jonathan Kent.Guys, you gotta hear this to believe it.Luthor: They won't raise the baby,because you will take him......put him back in his space crib,and launch him far, far away from this planet.Thus, Superman will never cometo exist here on Earth.[Over comm] And without Superman,the Justice League will never be formed.We will have won our greatest victory,and the world will be ours.Not if I have anything to say about it.-The Flash?Aquaman: You sound so surprised.He always shows up first.Forget them.

Will someone get Bizarro?Time trapper, seal the portal.[Both grunt]-You won't get away with this, Lex.-Hurry, before it shuts.You, protect me.[Heroes groan]Come, we have work to do.I brought my coupons,but I can't seem to find them.[Door opens & bell rings]-Can I help you all with something?Cheetah: I believe you can.I was just about to say,\"we're not in Kansas anymore.\"But this is the one time that doesn't work.I don't understand it, not one bit.That this little buggerwould just fall out of the sky?Oh, Paul, thank goodness he wasn't hurt.- Isn't he just the cutest?-Sure is, but who does he belong to?That's Solomon Grundy baby.Excuse me?The words my lovingand very tall spouse attempts to speak......are that you have found our baby,and we are eternally grateful.Solomon Grundy says thank youfrom bottom of inky-black soul.But how'd he get in this spaceship?Oh, that is no spaceship. It is, um....Simply is little baby carriagehis father made for him at the steel mill.Okay, then.Thank you very much.You can go home now.Nothing to see here. Bye.Have a nice life.[Engine starts]Mission accomplished.Aquaman: Hand over the Superbaby.-And nobody gets hurt.-Except for you four.-Honey, hold the baby, please.While I rip their heads off.[Cheetah snarls][Grunting][Yelling][Gasps][Toyman g roans]Whew.Aw. Superbaby so ugly.[Heroes grunting]If I can just break through his shield.Don't worry, Superbaby,we'll get you where you're supposed to be.Fumble! Baby fumble![Yelling][Bluegrass music playing on stereo]Ma, something strike youas odd about those two?Here, Mrs. Kent. Sorry for the ruckus.Raise this baby with all the love......you've always raised him with.I mean, um, no, don't worry about it.Just be you. You're a great parent.Gotta go. Bye, now.Mama, mama![Laughs]Both: Aah!Toyman: Mama! Ha-ha-ha.Mama!Me make sure you stayright here on Earth, Superbaby.[Grunts]Hello, Superbaby. Hello.Me doing all wrong.Time trapper:It is done.The past has changed,and there is a paradox in time.Thou should no longer existin this time frame.And I now have the powerto banish thee away.Superman.[All grunt][Both scream]Time trapper:But that is not all.Because there is no Supermanin this timeline......there would also be no Justice League.The Justice League is now erasedby mine own hand.It worked. It worked perfectly.-They are gone.-No.- I'll take them down myself.Dawnstar: Stop.You saw how time trapper erasedthe entire Justice League from existence.He could do the very same to us.We cannot win this fight. We must go.Legion of doom, l, Lex Luthor,have eliminated the Justice League.I now give you the world.We now rule with none to oppose us.Let anarchy reign. Let us dowith this pathetic planet as we please.It is ours, and there is no one left to stop us.Did you know that most stars in the skyhave died out thousands of years ago?-What?-The light takes so long to get here......it's already burned out.We're looking at ghosts in the night sky.They no longer exist.Dawnstar, I'm sorry.If--if I wasn't so hotheaded, I never would havelet Lex Luthor out of the ice in the first place.None of this would've ever happened.And I too am sorry.If only I had been more willing to be brave,I would have stopped Lex Luthor......before he escaped the 31st century.-We make lousy superheroes.-Yes. We are nothing like the Justice League.I wish we'd have just disappearedlike they did.Yes, perhaps it would have been better.Wait, that's it.Are you thinking what I am thinking?-That this tunnel really reeks?-No. Yes, it does.But more to the point, what if Lexno longer belonged to this timeline?If there was a paradox.Because he truly should not be herein the first place.Time trapper would send him packing,vanish him like the others.But more importantly,the paradox would change everything.If Lex Luthor was never frozen in ice, thenhe'd never even make it to the 31st century.He couldn't come backand cause all this trouble.-We'd undo everything that's gone wrong.-Yes.All that time, he was lost in those glaciers.Nobody could find him because nobodywas good enough to track him down.If we find Lex now,we could free him from that ice.He'd never even make it to the 31st century.But we'd need someone strong enoughto break him out.Let's do this.I fear we are going in circles.It took a massive ice thawand hundreds of years for civilization......to find Lex frozen in this wasteland.How am I to do it in only a few minutes?-Whoa. Definitely not what we were looking for.-No.And we all appearto be looking for the same thing.Black manta: Captain cold managedto put our leader, Lex, in this deep freeze.And we will find him first and save him.I swear it.Well, sorry, guys, you won't.It's gonna take nearly a millennia to find Lex.And when it happens,it definitely won't be by you guys.It is truth. We are from the futureand know this to be fact.My friend hereis the best tracker in the galaxy.The only way you're gonna find your bossis if you help us.No, I think better to simply crush you both.I'll hold them off. Keep looking.[Grunting]What are you doing?Keep searching for Lex.But that's just it. I think I found him.-Lex Luther's directly beneath you.-Then let's finish this.[Yells][All yell]May the warmth of anasissier Talmakfill you with health.What? What is going on?-You did it.-No, we did it.Let's just hope it works.[Time trapper laughing maniacally]-What are you laughing about?-The future has been changed by human hand.Thou no longer belongs in this timeline.It is now within my known powerto banish thee......to the ether of nonexistence.No, this is impossible.I control you.[Groans]Time trapper:No more.-If you banish me, you'll go too.-Not so.For I remain outside the paradoxbecause it is within my power.Lex Luthor, thou art banishedby mine own hand.No!Time trapper: As the sands of time runmine own will shall now be doneI will remake this world in darkness.[Laughs maniacally]We freed Lex Luthor,but do you think it set everything right again?Karate kid: That looks like oneof the time trapper's portals.Only bigger.Dawnstar: Oh, no, he must have gottenhis hourglass away from Lex.Whatever we did,we must have made it worse.-We must set this right, once and for all.-Wait. What about the time-paradox stuff?-If he sees us, he'll banish us too.-I fear we have run out of options.We have come to stop you, time trapper.Time trapper: Hmm. It seems thattwo little paradoxes were missed in all of this.No matter, for thou art too lateto save this world or yourselves.No one remains who can stop me.I wouldn't be so sure about that.-The Justice League.-Our plan worked.Time trapper:So be it, Justice League.[Gasps]Whoa.[Crowd screaming][All scream]I'm getting distress callsfrom all over the planet.I need the three of youto save as many lives as you can.The rest of us have to stop the time trapperonce and for all.Music to my ears.[Yells][Screaming][Grunts]Let's shut this operation down.[Groaning]-Thanks, kid.-That's what I'm here for.[Yells][Laughing maniacally][All yelling]I could use some big help here.[Gasps][All screaming]How do we stop this guy, Dawnstar?We can't even touch him.I cannot see the way. But I know you can.You have the abilityto see the weak point in any object.Focus your key.If time trapper has a weakness,you are the only one that can see it.But nothing shows up on this guy.It's like he has no key or energy.It's all blackness.The time trapper, he's made of dark matter.There's only one person among usthat can harm him.Me? I cannot, val.All this time you've been telling meto hold back, but now we need you to strike.Your light energy is the only thingthat can affect him.We need you now.[Dawnstar yells][Screams then grunts]Get the hourglass.It seems to be his power source.On it, bats.[Time trapper rasps]Time trapper, time's up.Turn the hourglass now.[Rasping][Time trapper screaming][All cheering]Whew. And the Justice League pull offanother fourth-quarter comeback.Whew. Well, since I'm here,I might as well get some roast pig.Or some fish tacos.Oh. Better not tell Aquaman.You two kids did great out there.You should consider sticking around.The Justice League could really useyour help in a fight.Normally, Superman, sir,I would have jumped at the chance......but quite frankly,I think I've learned my lesson.Yes, we must go back where we belong.Changing what has already occurredhas proven far too dangerous.But fighting along your side has taught usto face the future with courage.Well, you're always welcome here.You two are fine young superheroes.You should be proud.Time trapper,we have one last command of you.Take us home.I can't help but feelthere's something I'm forgetting.[Shivering]Superman:Going somewhere, Lex?Cold. So cold.Don't worry, Batman's volunteered a nicewarm cell for you at Blackgate prison.Black manta: Looks like everythingis back to normal, but Lex is getting locked up.He may as well be lost to usif that is the case.No, you two lack vision.This experiencehas taught us more about the future......than even my intellect could foresee.We will regroup with the others.And the legion of doomshall have our revenge.I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad to beback where everything is peaceful for once.-Even if it is a little boring.-Wait.Lex Luthor.Karate kid:I thought we set everything right.Dawnstar:But we must have missed some little thing.You know, Superman did tell uswe're welcome back any time.Then let us return in time,to the hall of justice.Do you want subtitles for any video?-=[ ai.OpenSubtitles.com ]=-"}

Start with Paris.And tell Borough Nationalthey can have 40 mil on Interbank.We're going to have to find someoneto ride shotgun over there.I'm not taking this roller coaster again.Earlier this week,the dollar slipped 50 points.It recovered. But a lot of peoplesay things are going to get worse...... before they get better.Others in the banking communitysay it was just a flutter.But if there's one thing all of usworry about, it's money. Our money.In this case, of course, the dollar.Here tonight to discuss the dollaris Maxwell Emery...... president of The First New York Bank.Mr. Emery has sometimes been calledthe lion of American banking.The dollar's been under pressureso frequently in our history.I don't think these times are exceptional.We go through regular cycles of anxiety.In fact, we're an anxiety-prone people.But we've never had anxietywith so much reason behind it.Since 1974, when the Arabsstarted increasing the price of oil...... they've amassed billions of dollars.Until now, they've been very kind to leavethat money largely in American banks.Mr. Emery, has there ever beensuch a concentration of wealth...... in the hands of one group before?No, I think probably not.But I assure you, their interests are ours.Have a good time.Thank you.- Wonderful party.- Charlie will be by later.- He's working late at the office.- See you then.Enjoy yourself.Want an educated opinion?You won't get a glamour boy like HubbellSmith to run a rescue operation over there.He won't touch it with a fork.He might. If the payoff is big enough.Could I have a white wineand a Scotch on the rocks, please?Well, Max, I hear you rode inon your white horse......and bailed out Borough National.Well, that fellow down there is trying,but he's overmatched.I feel sorry for the poor son of a bitchwho tries to fix that mess.I said I'd help thembut only if they'd take my boy.Wanna hear the deal?I don't know, Max.I did my time in the trenches......when I was runningthose problem loans for you.I had enough crash-and-burn.Hub......I'd consider it a personal favor.With those turkeys at Borough National,miracle is a better word.Now, why do you piss cold water on itwhen you know you're interested?What makes you so sure?The guy who turns them roundis going to be hero of the week.And we both knowthat you're restless, ambitious......and a sucker for a chanceat a star play.- That's the spirit that built the West.- Has either one of you seen Lee Winters?Last time I saw hershe was over by the band.Something wrong?Charlie Winters has been murdered.A mugger broke into his officeand knifed him.Oh, my God.Isn't it?I love the way he plays too. Don't you?- Hello, Bill.- Lee, could I talk to you alone?- Would you excuse us?- Certainly.What is it, Hub?Nothing.I was just thinking aboutthe illusion of safety.- Yes.- You were inquiring about Charlie Winters...... the other day.I'm sorry to have to tell you that he's dead.I was struck by the coincidence.Charles Winters.I'm sorry to hear about that.I'm sorry to hear about it too.I just wanted you to be aware.Good night.Police have concluded Charles Winterswas murdered by a burglar...... who panicked when Winters,who was working late, surprised him.No other motivationsfor his murder have been found.At his funeral yesterday in New York,his widow, ex-film star Lee Winters...... was accompanied by leading membersof the corporate and financial world.So Lee Winters, the poor girl whocame out of the dirt hills of Arkansas...... to achieve stardomas the glamorous Ashley Norman...... one of Hollywood'smost respected actresses...... who, at the height of her career,gave it up to become the wife...... of a great American industrialist...... played today her toughest role:where to go from here.There are rumors that thingsaren't what they were...... in the troubled petrochemical empirebuilt by Winters...... now facing the critical questionof who will become its next chairman.And now in a...Don't take too long.Hurry back down.- Gaby, did you take my book?- What book?Well, Paris, we're seeingsome pressure out of Zurich.Eleven's ringing. Who's on 11?But we think it's topping out.We're all atwitter.Let me have your dollar-franc, please.The question is, is he ready for us?I've had a balance sheet worked up......and a summary of assets.Is there anything else you might need?Oh, nothing special.Your interim financials maybe.Something showing your cash position,loan position, deposits.Also a P & L statement, if you've got one.The maturity schedules on your commercialpaper. Classifications on your loan portfolio.Maybe the last examiner's report.Oh, and your current profit breakdown.You sure that'll be enough?For a start.Cheers.Well, doctor, you've been on the casefor a while now. What's the prognosis?Will the patient live?The patient's been dead for six monthsand doesn't know it.Come on, now. It's not that bad.No?Roy, I salute you.Borough National's your masterpiece.Well, we may have to tighten our belt.Try it around your neck.Okay.- I'll call Emery. You can bail out.- No, I took this trip without a parachute.- This is when the fun begins.- Smith, this is not some sort of game.Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.You keep talking about a system, Roy.That's your problem.You can't beat the system,but you can win a game.- How?- First, we have to find a way......to get some profit in here now.Just 3 or 4 million......so we can meet that dividendand give ourselves a little time to breathe.A nice, hungry customerso we can give him a big, fat loan.Say, a couple 100 million.- Collect the commission.- Where are we gonna get the money?I'll find the money.What we need right now is a customer.We really need a company even morein the shithouse than we are.If that's possible.Sit down, Roy.Talk to me aboutthe Winterchem Petrochemical Corporation.We're loaned out to them to the legal limit.No matter how hungry they are,we can't give them a thing.Not even lunch?I'll start with what you're dying to hear.We don't need to borrow another dime.Well, I don't know what to say.All we have to do is scale down a little.Think in more modest terms,and we should weather the storm.I don't think it makes any sense at all.This is wrong. You can't cut back on thiscompany and expect it to ever grow again.The replacement costwould be astronomical.We're grateful for your interestin Winterchem.All the public relationsyou've put in for the company.And I know how you must feel,especially now that Charlie's gone.Henry, don't patronize me.You know where we went wrong. We let thecompetition walk away with the technology.Instead of cutting,we must invest in R & D.Keep the plants goinguntil new products are developed.- Financed how?- We'll just get ourselves a moneymaker.There's a small petrochemical plantin Spain at Valencia.They're in place.Their balance sheet looks real good.And they're for sale. We'd have to investin some updating and a sure feedstock.If we get it, we'll be buying ourselvesa real cash-flow machine.I hear you, but that kind of capitalis simply not available.Sorry, good people. I'm running late.Roy, fill me in on the rest of this later.Ms. Winters.- Henry.- Delighted to have met you.- Warner.- Good to see you.That's a hell of a fella. I thinkwe're gonna enjoy working with him.Let me speak with Lee Winters, please.She's at the far corner table.Lee, you're gonna be openingthe Palm Beach house soon?Sorry, Mrs. Winters, a call for you.Thank you. Excuse me, I'm sorry.Yes, this is Mrs. Winters.How good are youat keeping a straight face?Because your Valencia dealhappens to be full of holes.Helen, I can't talk now.I'm at a luncheon meeting.- lf you have some messages...- Try this on Helen.Number one, what aboutcurrency translation?A Spanish plant has peseta obligations.If the peseta goes up...... your dollar earnings won't be wortha plate of frijoles.Two, how about labor stability?Half the country's busy slipping bombsin the pockets of the other half.Three, Winterchem's tapped outwith us at Borough National.How do you figure to fundthe acquisition?I see.Is that all, Helen?Sorry, but I didn't wanna embarrass youin front of Tweedledum and Tweedledee...... since it's obvious that you wanna bethe new chairman of the board.No, absolutely not. Would you tell himI'm out of town, please?I'm sorry. Some peoplejust don't understand business.Absolutely.Of course we're gonna show a profit.One, their currency may be unstable, butthey have to sell in international markets......so our dollar wouldn't be affected.Two, the Spanish labor markethappens to be relatively strike-free......which you would have knownif you'd bothered to check, as I did.Three, there are other banks that recognizea sound investment when they see one.As for that \"chairmanof the board\" remark......Mr. Smith, I don't knowwhat you're talking about.How much stock did you sayher husband left her?You were saying?I thought we ought to have a drink on it.On what exactly?Your future at Winterchem.Scotch, if you don't mind, with a twist.Mr. Smith, you must have me confusedwith an executive.They tolerated me on the boardbecause of Charlie.But now that he's gone, I'm justan ex-movie star coasting into the sunset.Not someone throwing thema curve ball at lunch......about a Spanish petrochemical plant.I'd say you coast pretty good.Where'd you learn the moves?Charlie involved me a lot in the business.And when I was an actress,I had my own company.I made my own deals.Charlie always says I have...Charlie used to say I had good instincts.Well, we're playing the classic scene,aren't we?The banker and the widow.I'm sorry. I guess this is all too soon.Of course it's too soon.Everything's too soon, isn't it?The company's in trouble too soon.Charlie died too soon.So what?lt'd be funny, wouldn't it?If the banker helped the widowwalk off with the chairmanship.Hilarious.You mind telling me how?- Your Valencia deal.- I thought you said it was full of holes.I thought you saidyou didn't wanna be chairman.Too bad because Ackerman'sjust blowing smoke......about all this so-called support.Nobody really wants to sell off.Nobody wants to be on the boardof a shrinking company.You nail that deal, you have a real shot.Providing they took me seriously.Come up with the 500 million to buythat plant, and they'll take you seriously.All you need is the okayfrom Ackerman to go after it.And I'm in a position to put youtogether with the money.There are risks involved.I've never been afraid of risks.That was Scotch with a twist.For one thing, I'm not gonna get the okay.Aren't you the man that told meWinterchem......was borrowed out with the bank?I'm the man.- Where's the money supposed to come from?- Private placement. Outside source.- Direct?- Through an agent I know.We'd have to negotiate with his people.Probably be a joint venture if they put upthe capital and share the profits.And the bank collects 1 percentfor setting it up.On 500 million, that's 5 million profit.No risk to you.You have a very profitablesense of humor, Mr. Smith.You wouldn't deny me a little incentive,would you?No.Was that on the rocks or straight up?Of course, we do have to handle hervery carefully.Yes. She is sitting on the largest blockof company stock.If she sells her stock to some outfit,we could all be out on our collective ass.I say to hell with her damn stock.What's she gonna do, unload600,000 shares? That's her meal ticket.This isn't The Washington Post,and she's not Katherine Graham.And I'll tell you, that woman is not goingto negotiate any deals for this management.Ever.Would you ask Mrs. Wintersto come in, please?Next thing she'll wantto be chairman of the board.Now, Lee, we want you to knowyou'll always have a home at Winterchem.Remember, we'll always be happyto hear any suggestions you might have.- Mr. Ackerman, please.- One moment, please.- At least we didn't overestimate him.- Hello.- Warner, this is Hub.- Hi, what's up?Nothing special. I just thoughtit was time we sat down......and had a talkabout rescheduling your loans.- Maybe lunch next week?- How about Thursday?Right, fine.By the way, I had a talkwith that Japanese conglomerate......that's buying up every company in sight.- Did you?Yeah, Shigemitsu-Han.They wanted to talk aboutthe Winterchem financials.Of course, I wouldn't,but I thought you ought to know.No problem.They tried to take us over last year...... but couldn't get enough stock.Well, in that case, we can all relax.So where do you guys like to eat?How about the Bibliothequenext Thursday at 1?- Thursday at 1, right.- See you then.I can't wait to see their faceswhen they think I'm gonna sell my stock.- Hello.- Helen.Would you contact Shigemitsu-Han and askif we can have lunch Thursday at 1.Thursday at 1.Hi, Lee.So she won't sell her stock, huh?Good move, Warner.Well, I'm starved. How about you guys?- I could use a drink.- So could I.How did I do?Ackerman didn't eat a bite.- How long do we have to wait?- As long as it takes.- lf it takes.- Patience, patience.They have to huddle first.Look unconcerned, get back to the officeand argue a little bit.They're probably flipping a coin right nowto see who has to make the call.Yeah.Right, put him on.Guess who lost.Hey, Warner, long time no see.Hi. Listen, Hub,I know you'll think I'm nuts...... but we may let Lee Winters check outthe financing on that Spanish thing after all.She's got an idea she can findthe 500 million somewhere privately.She'll probably give away the family jewelsto get it.Would it make you happierif I kept an eye on her for you?Jesus, could you?That would be really terrific.- We don't want to look like total idiots.- Consider it done.Hub, I want you to knowwe'll always be grateful.Just your friendly neighborhood banker.They'll always be grateful.We're not there yet.You still have to meet the agentfor the 500 million tonight at Emery's.Any ideas on how I should handle it?Straightforward.We've got nothing to hide.Do we?Please, Ms. Winters, excuse me.I know this isn't the time or place......but did your husband ever mentionJerry Fewster?There's someone named Fewster. Did yourhusband ever mention anything about him?In what connection?- You mean he didn't?- I don't know. What was it about?No, if he didn't mention it, that's fine.It's fine.- What did you say the name was?- No, it doesn't matter.I'm sorry I bothered you.- Excuse me, does he work here?- You mean Mr. Fewster?He's one of the federal bank examinerswho come in.He's very nervous.I don't believe Mr. Winterstold her anything.She looked right at me.She didn't know what I was talking about.That's my train.Well, if you hear from her again,we expect to hear from you.Okay?Not gonna eat your hot dog, huh?- Well, here they are.- Oh, Hub.- I was concerned.- Courtney, I'm sorry we're late.- You know Lee Winters?- Good evening. Lovely to have you.Would you take her down by Max?- Good evening.- Good evening.- Sorry we're late.- Don't worry about it. So glad you're here.- Hello, Hub.- Sorry, Max, got caught in traffic.Lee, I'd like you to meet Sal Naftari.How do you do, Mr. Naftari?Mrs. Winters, at last. I was beginningto be afraid I might not get to meet you.For a few seconds there,I had doubts myself.But I can't tell you how happyI am that we made it.Oh, Mrs. Winters, I was just telling Maxbefore you came......that I've just come back from Paris.The state of the dollar is in crisis.I don't know what you naughty bankersare gonna do to us next.Do you know that I couldn't buya single thing?It's awful. I'm gonna have to wearAmerican clothes all summer.- Two percent.- Not this time.Okay, 2 and a half.Eight.Eight? Why 8?It's a woman. Makes it tougher.Hub, get it out of your head.I've got a lock on this.These people are unpredictable.They make up their own minds.I'm only the agent.I can only make the introductions.The rest is up to you.If my deal is too rich, you're alwayswelcome to try it on your own.- Okay, 8.- Plus a fee of 300,000 for contingencies.- Such as?- lf I knew, they wouldn't be contingencies.I'll get right on it, providing,of course, that's acceptable.Also, she'll have to travel.They'll want a meeting.- We welcome you.- Thank you, Khalid.We're glad to be here.My associate, Mrs. Winters.- How do you do?- Mrs. Winters, welcome. Please.Come.I believe you know my father, Ahmed.Of course.He thanks you for honoring uswith your visit.Not at all.You honor us with the invitation.And Mrs. Winters.How do you do?I feel like a beggar asking themfor alms, and I hate it.You and the rest of the world.I thought we had an appointment.This is an appointment.Mrs. Winters, please.Hub, good to see you.To begin with, I'm sure you will be pleasedto hear we have decided to make the loan.But first, I think it best to go over this......to make sure we are clearon the main points.Point one......the sum is to be 500 million,of course, for the plant in Valencia......the money to be drawnin units of 50 million.At times to be negotiated.Yes, of course.Point two, Winterchem to hold title......but profits to be sharedon an equal basis.Point three, Mrs. Winters' stockwill stand as security......for the entire transaction.- Point four...- Excuse me.That means if something happens,I lose all my stock.Mrs. Winters......I should tell youthere are those in the family......who do not think we should bemaking this offer at all.I assume if you could've foundventure capital of this sort......for a company like Winterchemin America......you would not be comingall the way to Arabia looking for it.If you are able to arrange better termselsewhere, you are free to do so.Shall I continue?Point four......after repayment of the principalhas been completed......all interest payments must be madeby the 15th day of each month.If we're ever cash short when a paymentcomes due, I could lose the whole company.Don't worry. We'll cover you on that.The bank will cover you.I don't like the risk.I guess it depends on how badyou wanna be the chairman.Well, I guess I should call the cockpit.Have them radio the officewith the gory details.Hey, that can wait.This can't.You're really ticked offabout the deal, aren't you?I'm sorry.I just don't...I don't like being dependent, that's all.I was never dependenton any one studio.I didn't depend on Charlie.And if anything goes wrong, I don't likebeing dependent on Borough National.You mean me.Here.If you can't live with the deal, forget it.Tell New York the termsare unacceptable.I warn you, I'm a problem.I'm a bad personwhen I get in a corner.Fine. If you get in a corner,tell me to go to hell.In business, that's the ground rules.But if you think the only thing we'vebeen doing together is business......one of us is a fool.Would you radio Winterchemin New York, please?Tell them we've come to termson the whole package.Well, you got your deal.You got what you want.You don't knowthe first goddamn thing I want.It's not the deal.The world's full of deals.A partner's somewhat more rare.I'm still not sure I trust you, you know.That's a perfect basis for a partnership.Thirty thousand.Just bumped him out of 20 million.I thought you ought to see that.They just want us to hold it?Not roll it over?Doesn't make sense.They'll lose a ton of interestif they don't re-deposit that money.Must be a mistake.Ask them to send it again.You got it.By the way,how much is the deposit for?Altogether, 95 million.Rebecca, let's get a confirmation on that.Let me have the maturity schedules......on those Saudi Eurodollar depositswe're holding.The ones that are due nowor all of them?- The works.- What's going on?Nineteen depositsworth 5 million each are due......and the Saudis didn'tgive us disposition instructions.You got 23 more maturingin the next three weeks......which is 210 million we're gonnahave to come up with......if they decide not to roll over.- Two hundred and ten million?That's practically every cent we carry.It'll clean us out.They can't let that moneysit without earning interest.Even the Arabs aren't that rich.Maybe they'll advise us throughtheir London affiliate, I hope.Forty-60, anything there?If you wait five minutes,I'll have an answer.That yen deal we lost, who wasthe customer, and why did we lose it?Hapsas Oil. First New Yorkmust have wanted the trade badly.They bid one point over market.Mr. Naftari returning your call.- Put him on. I got five minutes to kill.- Yes, sir.I don't know. Some guys will goanywhere to find a topless beach.Hey, Sal, how's Monte Carlo, you turkey?- Not bad. Something on your mind?- No, nothing special......except your friend Dawasir doesn't seemto have both his oars in the water.What's going on?They got a couple of Eurodollardeposits maturing. No big deal.But they're just letting them sit.You happen to know anything about it?Nobody's talked to me.I haven't heard a word.Well, Europe's gonna startclosing in a few minutes.They work through London and Zurich,and the interest they're losing...Well, what about it?Hub, you got a problem?Hey, listen, if it's okay with them,it's just fine with me. What do I care?Then there's no problem?Yeah, kid, talk to you.Shit.He said you don't seem to haveboth of your oars in the water.You cannot pull $95 millionin one chunk......from a bank the sizeof Borough National.When I undertook to manage this plan......you agreed to do it graduallyin small amounts.You're now starting to move billionsin a matter of weeks.The world economic situationis deteriorating......more rapidly than we had thought.We don't think we can affordto wait, Max.There will be no collapse in theforeseeable future unless you panic......and start it with somedamn fool move like this.And if you are wrong, what then?We wake up one morning,our oil is gone.We find we have sold all we have inexchange for paper money that is worthless.You're risking immediate exposure.We risk it every day.If Charles Winterscould stumble on that account......it's just a question of timebefore someone else finds out.- And when that happens...- No one else will find out......if you revert to your original timetable.All right, Max.We'll think about it.But I'm not surewhat our answer will be.You're playing with the endof the world, you know.The end of the world as you know it.Europe's closing.You're on your own. No dispositions.I don't want anyone playing hero.- Give me the FYCB.- Okay, let's hedge ourselves.Cover at least half the amountof the deposits for one day.First New York and Morgan,24 million each.Morgan, this is Borough National.First New York,let me have your Fed Funds desk.Listen, we got room for 24, 25.- Right.- No problem, get back to you.- Morgan's tight today.- First New York's dry.Come back tomorrowif we have a problem.This could be a real situation here,Europe closing down.If we can't find the cash to cover thoseEurodollar deposits we're shit out of luck.Okay, try Boston and Chase, but that's it.Let's not blow it all over the street.As long as nobody else knows...Now what the hell is that?Dollar's dropping.Dropping? It's going throughthe basement, for chrissake. Why?Hey, Hub, it's Paris. They heard somebig Arab money is pulling out here.- They're gonna start shorting dollars.- They're nuts.Negative. Kill those callsto Boston and Chase.- That's what they said.- Tell them we're buying.- We're buying?- Tell them.Dollar dropping fast against marks and yen.Add sterling and guilders to that.Okay, just button up. No more callsgo out of here until I tell you.You better call your mama, both of you.You're gonna be late for supper.Vince, this is Gil. I'm bottom-fishing.You got any ideas?No, no, nothing definite.I wanted to flag it at the Fedjust in case.- Hang up.- No, not much.Maybe 100 mil or so.Hang up that phone, Roy, or so help meGod, I'll tear it out of the wall.Sorry, I'm getting a little static here.I'll be back to you.Look, Smith, you can save the dramaticsfor some other time.Are you crazy?Are you right out of your fucking skull?Nobody knows we're broke.I'm busting my assto act like business as usual......and you call the Federal Reserve Bank.Why not take an adin The New York-fucking- Times?Everything is drying up on you.You can't get it anywhere.I say we go to the Fed and make a cleanbreast of it.And blow everything.Look, the Fed will never find out.We'll issue some domestic CDsto cover the Eurodollar deposits.By the time we add up our tabs,it'll be two weeks from now.By then, everything will be fine.So we ran a little behindon bookkeeping. So what?You can't do that. That's illegal.That is criminal, for chrissake.Mildly. We can get by with itfor one night.- You don't know what's gonna happen.- Walk to the Fed......let them know,I'll tell you what's gonna happen.You won't open tomorrow.With the performance record you've had,they'll shut our ass down for good.We gotta sweat it out and praythe Saudis roll over that 95 million......before Europe opens in the morning.It's the only chance we got.Come on, Roy, where's your balls?You're the one who's crazy.I don't know anything about this.I am not losing my deniability.You can hide in the closetif you want to......but you're staying right here.If I catch you on the phone,I'll break your fucking arm.What are you gonna doif the Saudis ask for that money?I'll worry about it in the morning.I gotta get through the night first.Sorry, Eurodollar section says the market'sgetting worse. Liquidity's drying up.- How much of this is around the floor?- Not a lot.Okay, here's the drill. For the rest of theafternoon, no strong positions, no exposure.- Keep it humming. You got me?- Yes, sir.Hong Kong opens 8:00 our time.Maybe they'll run it through them.You and Betsy stay. I'll get backfrom reception as soon as I can.You're not going to that Wintersreception tonight, are you?We're expected.And since the only conceivable reason forour absence would be a crisis at the bank......and since that's what we don't wantpeople to know we're up to our ass in......one of us better be there.She's only the new chairman of the boardof one of our biggest customers.Excuse me just a second, Howard, Nancy.- Hello, Mr. Smith.- Good evening.Are you over your jet lag?- Bankers aren't allowed to have jet lag.- Oh, no?I feel lucky. Warner's agreedto be chief operating officer.Glad to hear it.Roy Lefcourt sends his congratulations.He's a little under the weather.Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.I appreciate your being here.Thanks for your help.This is gonna work out all right.Oh, thank you.N-A......blank, blank, L-E.Cremona.Me, any joy?No. Nothing moving herebut the leaves on the trees.Hong Kong opens in 10 minutes.Want me to take a sniff?And have it in Paris throughthe back door? Better not.How's our friend bearing up?I think he has visionsof numbers on his chest.He's not the only one.Let's keep the hatchesbattened down. Not a word.Well......that sounds fine.Just keep tracking.We could get a move out of it.I'll check in myself if I get a chance.Not the bank.I might have to drift over therefor a couple of minutes.Tonight?Nothing they couldn't handle themselves.But I think I better look in on them.- Don't wait up for me.- You're so tense.Are you all right?"}

A womanwho had worked all night?!Is there no other option?No. I need to see Madame Cesar,and I'm in a hurry.She'll be pissed.I don't care. If she makes a fuss,tell her that \"things are getting better.\"Are they getting better? How so?You don't have to understand.Just repeat what I said. Go!Hey, do you have a garage?I've got a loaded truck baking in the sun.- I don't have a garage!- What about the shed?We removed all the tables.There's nothing there now...Well, well, well.Looks like the little one knowsyour business better than you do!Ha!That's it!Well?Worked all night?- Yes!Between waiting tables,serving lemonade and beer,and today, it continues forBastille Day.What are you looking at?- The glass...- Because it's dirty?No...

What guy?A guy...- And what does he want from me?- I have no clue.He told me to tell you that\"things are getting better.\" - What?!He told me to tell you,that \"things are getting better\"!Done.Are you afraid someone will stealyour sheep?You're accountable for the goods youcarry. Don't you get that?I have 22 of them.And that's what I have to deliver.I can see that you're a serious person!- That's right.- Hey!Madame Cesar is waiting for you.- See you later?- Later.Thanks for the garage.I know you're having fun,washing up naked in front of me.You're doing thisto show me that...... I am no more to youthan a dog or a bug on the wall!Only I'm not a dog nor a bugthat you can squash, you know?!I'm a man!I'm a man, you hear?!I thought you were in a hurry.After all I've done for you,no appreciation!Where would you be right nowif it wasn't for me? Where, huh?!In prison.I shouldn't have helped you.I should have left you where you were.That's not true.You felt strong,having the old fool in your pocket!Because you can dowhatever you want with me!Well, go ahead andtell me, so I can hear it!If that's what you want to hear,you only need to repeat it.- Do you know who you are?- You've already told me.Here you go.Your ragu for lunch.Cook it over low heat.I don't know what time I'll be back.But when I come back, I want to seea revolver on this table!Do you understand?Put the revolver down.And get dressed.A revolver in the handsof a naked woman is rather funny.You should always think carefullybefore you pull the trigger.If you shoot too soon or too late,there can be unfortunate consequences.For both.Allow me to give you some advice.Tread carefully with the old man:he has, after all, done a lot for you.Just a little gratitude, huh?!What are you doing here?Your friend sent me.Kopetsky.Where is he?Safe.He's taken care of by a friend.Why didn't he come himself?With three bullets in your hide,you can't always go where you want to.Why did he run away?He had only three months left to serve.82 days, to be exact.He must have gone crazy.Yes.This is clearly hard for youto understand.Women get used to everything.What is three months?You haven't been to prison.I don't have time to chat.The barge leaves at 6 o'clock.Do you have the documents?- What documents?- Yours!I'm not going.Oh, yeah?What about Kopetsky?He's waiting for you.Do you know that?!It doesn't concern you.It's my business.Give me the money!HIS money. 300,000 francs.Not a penny less!We need what Kopetsky left you,for passports and ticket fares.I had the money. Now I don't.So...Here's my advice to you:I asked you a question.Think carefully before you answer.I don't want to upset Kopetskywhen I tell him what I had to doto get his little dove to talk.It's not just about HIS life,but also about the lives of two others.And above all - my own!I told you, I no longer have that money.They took it away from me.- Then who has it?The old man.Do you think if I had that money,you would have found me here?Why did you give it to him?Give?!When the police cameto arrest Kopetsky, I ran away.I met the old man,and he took pity on me.I was innocent,but I couldn't prove it.He put my suitcase and the moneyin a safe place, saying:\"If you need them, I'll give themback. You can trust me!\"And when I asked for them,he said, \"You can go to the police!\"A-ha...Well, I'll wait for his return.And what are you going to do to him?Nothing.I'll just ask him a few questions.I know him. He won't answer you.I am convinced of the opposite.If you don't have very strong nerves,just get out and let medo the talking.And don't be afraid of anything.It won't take long.There are four of us.- I was told three.- We're taking one woman with us.- A woman?!- Yes.The one with the money.- And where did this woman come from?She's the one who'swith the photographer.Anyway, do what you want,but I don't know anything!Understood?- Yeah, yeah.That's funny!You couldn't choose a name?You'd better seeif the description fits.You have the photos?- Oh, crap, the photos!Yeah. You don't think I havephotos of every gangster on earth?What about the photographer's girlfriend?- Yes, but I have to go there for that.That's your problem.Listen...Don't forget...- Yes, I will. Later.You'll get this later, too.Hey, what do you mean later?What am I going to do?- Go get your photos taken!Yes, I know that.But I still have a problem.What problem?My friend has 3 bullets in his stomach.He needs to be taken care of!Well! Oh-la-la-la... Well, then...That doesn't concern me!- What do you mean, doesn't concern you?It's included in the price!You're going to keep him here!Are you crazy?Today is the 14th of July,with people coming and going.Where is he?- In the truck.You mean, you have a truck?Maybe you'd have preferredthat we come by bus?Okay. Wait for me.I'm going to get dressed.Boss...Boss!Boss!What do you want?Oh, what a bed!It feels so good!Listen, don't put your dancingshoes on my bedspread!Well?Don't you know better than to look ata woman when she's getting dressed?And if he tells youthere's no money in the house?Where did he put it?In the bank, maybe? Do you thinkhe'd be happy to take you there?People like him don't trust anyone.The money is probably here.I'd be surprised.The one he trusts least is me.Why does he lock everything up?And why does he always leave mewithout a penny?Because he lives in fear that one day he'llcome home and find I'd flown the coop.- You don't need money to fly away.- Maybe.But you need ticketsto take a train or a boat!It's also possibleto take off on foot.No, I have to go faraway to save myself.Otherwise he'll call the gendarmesright away and I'll be arrested.No...I have no choice.Here it's either him or prison.I don't think you're interestedin my story. All you want is the money.Indeed!I'm going to have to go somewhere else.Let's talk about this revolver.Do you know how to use it?Then why?No, I hide it.When the old man looks at me...if you could his eyes!For four years, day and night,I was alone with those eyes!Those eyes that never stopwatching me.Are you afraid of him?Anyone would be afraid.If I were you, I'd have preferredprison. It has windows with bars,but luckily, there are also files,without which...I wouldn't be here today.I wish you the best of luck.Oh, I forgot. A friend of mine willarrive in a truck to pick me up.Tell him to wait for me at the portat Madame Cesar's, understand?Bye.- What are you going to do now?That's my own business.What do I tell Kopetskyif he asks me?The truth.And you think he could bearsuch truth?No, I'll make up a story for him.I'll tell him, for example,that you're dead.A dead woman doesn't sleepwith monsieur Blanche.I mean, the dead knowhow to behave, right?I hope he can take a blow.That's what I'll tell him.Wait!I'll try to save him,even if I have to use meansthat disgust me.And you think that in a few hours you canfind 300,000 francs? Are you kidding me?I know a man...whose interest is to help me.Is that so?This explains why you haven't writtenKopetsky for 14 months.But that's none of my business.What matters is that he give you the money.He doesn't have any,but his fiancee is very rich.But why would this girl help you?He cares about me.I don't get it.And she cares about him even more.Who is this man?A man.I first saw him, when he cameto have his photo taken.Since then,he's been coming here often.As soon as Blanche looked away,he immediately came to see me.And does she know that he loves you?She doesn't know anything.Yeah, I see.This is all very nice,but we don't have time.The barge departs at 6 o'clock.That gives you another eight hours.Hello?Put me through to 326-42.Hello, I'd like to speakwith Monsieur de Tercy.A contract is a contract!And a good financial relationshipleads to friendship.Besides, I don't see anyany real discrepancies.The interests of the newlyweds will remaininterconnected for the rest of their lives.Everything is settledto support their happiness.If your father were alive, he would'venever signed a contract like that!Don't be nervous, godfather.I know very well what I'm doing, andI'm not leaving any of my family out.But you do!You're shortchanging yourself!You and your mother, and your aunt.Excuse me, Monsieur de Tercy,but what do you bring into thisbesides your son?I didn't ask for anything, monsieur.It was offered to me.Unbelievable!My fiance has no money, andI'm lucky enough to have it.Why shouldn't I share this moneywith the man I'm marrying?Yes, but to pay the father's rent?!I can have a penniless fiance,but I can't be a poor man'sdaughter-in-law.Thank you, dear child.If I may make one observation,Let's briefly summarize both points of viewso we can see things more clearly.- What is it, Angele?- There's a call for monsieur Maurice.Tell them to call back later.Leave us.I told them, but they say it's urgent.If it's urgent, darling, go!Excuse me.Let's continue, counselor.The interests of the newlyweds will remaininterconnected for the rest of their lives.- Who's asking for me?- A lady.- What lady?- I've no idea.Do you think I know everyonewho's chasing you?Does it concern you?So, have they set a date?No, right now they're discussing money.You can't live on love alone...Certainlywhen you're of a certain age...Yes?You?!That's impossible!Look, I can't leave.The lawyer is here.What do you mean,\"so much the better?\"What?!Are you crazy?!You can't do that!Listen to me!But... listen to me!Okay, I'll be right there.Bad news?When you get married, affairsare over and done with.But that still leaves the maids.How nice the birds are!Yes.The birds are nice, yes.The birds aren't the only onesWho are nice.You think so?Why, don't you?- You, for example?- Why not?What will your mistress say?Oh, I don't care.Are you afraid of her?I have business with her.I don't want to mix businesswith pleasure. It gets in the way.If you have business with her, it's bestto mix the two.

But in the end,I think it works out fine.What a sense of humor!Hurry up, or they'll start askingwhere I've gone. What's the matter?I need money.- Excuse me?- I need money, like you.What's so unusual about that?- But...Nothing, of course, but...I don't really understandWhat this has to do with me?I'm counting on youto give it to me.As a parting gift of sorts.Me?!You know I don't have a penny!You understand thatI'm going to marry Lucette precisely...Or else...Or else I'll make a scandal!You're crazy!Do you know what you callwhat you're doing?Blackmail.

If you makea face like that in the photo...Say, what if he croaksby the end of the day?It's the same price for the dead.- Fear not the dead... See you tonight.- See you tonight.He wanted to live with me.He ran away because of me.He was wounded because ofhis love for me.Now he cries for me to come.And if I don't go to him,I'll be blamed.What gives a man the right to make demandson a woman just because he loves her?The fact that she once loved him too.Now you've fallen out of love with himand you think you're even?I know he loves you.And I know,that you loved him, too.I know your life better than you do.Every gesture, every look,every word you say.I know the story of yourmeeting in Marseilles,on a Saturday, in the middle of summer.How in the evening you gotundressed for the first time.How your body was tanned...Up to here.The room was small, the bed narrow...Shut up.And you left for Monte Carlo.And there you were starving.And one day at the markethe stole oranges.He couldn't bear to see you suffer.He found a job for a few days,you were able to rent a room.To celebrate, he went outto buy you candy and cake.Your favorites.You ate them,sitting naked on the bed...And he's been nibbling crumbsoff your skin.You laughed like children.I know all about you.Your face when you sleep.The expression of your eyesin the morning, when you wake up.You wake up very slowly.He takes a long time to movehis lips over your forehead,until you deignto open your eyes.One evening,when you couldn't sleep,he told you a story about a child,that he heard from his mother.An old fairy tale.You laughed at him,and he was offended.And you never understood why.Do you remember?No.It's quite possible.Women prefer to forget,often unconsciously,such uncomfortable memories.Have you also forgottenthe cashier that he attackedto get you food and clothes?Four years!He paid the price for this lunacy.Four years!Four long years in a cellalone with his love,of which he spoke to meevery single day.Every night!Until your face appeared in front of me.I begged him to shut up,I couldn't listen to it anymore.But he talked and talked.Nothing could stop him.He, too, felt that there werethree of us in the cell:him,you,and I.When I decided to escape,I had to take him with me.Or else he would have given me awayout of jealousy.I thought you were his friend.His friend...Who has friends?No one.Do you have them?No.We're beginningto understand each other,but not like those who lie to themselves,so as not to face the truth.Not like Kopetsky,who absolutely refuses to believethat you no longer love him.And you don't love him anymore.Say it!Please say it!Why?I want to hear you say it.You may have noticed that in caseof separation or divorce,Maurice will leave onlywith what he came with,and monsieur de Tercy's rentwill no longer be paid.I don't see how I get hurt here.Your father turned a crappy little shopinto a terrific store!He created this house you live inby his work and enterprise!Oh, godfather, if daddy could readwhat's in my heart and in my head,I'm sure he'd approve of me.I'm sure he would!This young oneis better than all of us!I think Madame is right.Would you like me to re-read theparagraphs about everybody's share?Exactly, exactly!Especially the part aboutthe death of my goddaughter!Lucette!You took a long time!Where have you been?- Come out, we need to talk.- Now? Don't even think about it!It's very urgent.In that case, solicitor,please excuse me.Well?I need to talk to you in private.Okay, let's go.Say it!It's not that easy.What's going on? You've been gonefor almost an hour. Where were you?I'm in a terrible mess.Everything is in jeopardy:our wedding,our love.- I'm sorry, I don't understand.It's pretty simple:I need 300,000 francsby 3 o'clockand I don't have it.300,000 francs? What for?It's a debt of honor.And if I don't pay it...I knew you had debts.But a debt of honor is something new!It happens.What does sheoffer you in return?She?!Who is \"she\"?Your mistress.What does that mean?!Everybody knows that.Me too, of course.At the store, they made allusions...On the street, snippets of phrases,knowing smiles...- I swear...!- Oh, don't swear.Soon you'll be swearing allegianceto me. I need to believe it.- You don't believe me.- But I do.You never answered me:what does she offer in return?She'll go away.Аnd if you don't give her the money?She'll make a scandal.Can you help us?- Us? Who are you talking about?- You and me, of course.Naturally.Well...I agree.We can't let her live in sorrowalongside our happiness.- I need the money by 3 o'clock.- She has a train to catch?Don't joke.When are you going to give it to me?I'll bring it to her myself.You?!Women can settle such cases betteramong themselves.But, of course, you'll accompany me.Let's go!We don't have much time to lose!Have you lost your mind?You're supposed to honk your hornand wait outside.You didn't knowwho you were going to meet here!Don't get upset.I'm here to see the photographer.But if I'm disturbing you...Aren't you going to introduce meto the lady? - What's wrong?Everything's just fine.But knock on wood, you never know.Don't play dumb! Tell me!Hey, I've been on edge sinceyesterday, so watch it!So, for the passport photos,I decided to see a photographer.So here I am.For us, it's going to be easy.But Kopetsky? I couldn't bring him.So I thought, maybe she has somesouvenirs from the good old days.I have no souvenirs.Maybe among all the photosyou have in your closets,there'd be one of some guy whoresembles him a little.Find a guy who's skinny...Well, you know him...It's quite possible.Would you look for it?Fine.Well, you didn't pick the worst job!What did you do with the old man?He's doing his own job.He's with the gendarmes, takinghunting photos.And the money?It's not as simple as we thought.How's that?Did she spend Kopetsky's money?- No, it was taken from her.- Is she fucking with you?- No.It's true.Well, well.Just remember, everything has to betaken care of by 6:00.From my end, everything is arranged:The barge, the passports.And Kopecky?What have you done with him?He's already aboard, hiding.How is he?So so.And his wound?Not so good.Do you think he'll make it?I hope so, for his sake.Not for yours?What are you trying to say?Nothing. Just a thought.After all, he's your pal,not mine.It's normal that you'dworry about him, but...that filly over theredoesn't seem to care much.She hasn't asked me about him.- Did he talk to you about her?- He did, but do you realizethat he can't talk about anything else?- Will you go back to see him?- I have to keep him informed.After all, it's his womanand his dough, isn't it?!What are you going to tell him?For him to do as I did - wait.Here you go.Take all this.It feels good to give me all thisfor Kopetsky, isn't it?All right, come on.After all, if it were me,I don't know what I would have done.That's what I would do.Take a look at what's in here. He musthave changed in the past few years.I'm not sure I'd recognize him.Come this way.Let's get on with it. I can't keepmy load for hours in the sun.Sheep are good natured,but I'd rather have themin the shade, locked up in the barn.If you want it to go faster,shut your big mouth!All right. Come on, lady, as you can see,he can't wait for me to leave.That's it?Right.It's better to hurry upwith the money.We have to be on the bargeby six, don't forget.Don't worry.Pick us up at 5:00. Got it?- I'll see you then. And thank you.Ladies and gentlemen...Your turn.Look (at the camera).You told him to come pick us up.So?You know I'm not going with him.Wait.Not with him. With me.For four years I've been livingnext to a woman I don't know.And today...she's here in front of me.I don't want to ever lose her.You're coming with me!I'll take care of all the rest.You agree?- Did you see her?- Yes.And, young man, you didn't exaggerate.She has a great figure!What did she... what did she say?Did she talk about me?About you?Yes, a little bit.- And what did she say?- Come on, pal, all these questions!How could I remember everything?She filled my head with Kopetsky!Kopetsky this and Kopetsky that!I don't know what you dowith the girls, but they love you!- Why didn't she come with you?- And the money? She has to get it.You don't think she keeps it in a drawer,do you? She has to look where she hid it.On top of that, today is a holiday.And that doesn't make things easier.- And Serge?- He's helping her.- Are they together?- Look, what other option is there?I'd rather have you stay with her.Me or someone else,what difference does it make?The important thing is that all fourof us are out of here tonight. Right?Yes. Did she tell you whyshe didn't write me,She did! She said, she said...She said to give you this.Isn't that enough? Look!It's better than words.Here's some clothes for you...And she gave me thisto cheer you up.See, she thought of everything.Come on, have a drink.A few more hours.and you'll have everything:freedom, a doctor...and your Barbara.Is that okay with you?Bye, kid.And long live the king!Long live the king!Long live...Hey, chase him away.He's out of his mind!Come on, let go of your king.- Hey, what's that?- We've had it with you and your king!Come on, come on, let's go.- Long live the king!All the same,it's a beautiful July 14th.- To your health!- And yours.And life is beautiful!Shit!- Am I interrupting something?- No, no, no, no.Armand. My cousin Armand.The black sheep of the family.A gendarme. And this is a friend...An old friend from Morocco.Albert.Hello, monsieur Albert.Don't tell me you came all the wayfrom Morocco just to see Juliette?No, silly! He came from Lyonwith a load of sheep. He's a trucker.What's up? How's Mathilde?It's not working.Are you going to cryon my shoulder again?It's the same thing every time.You could have warned meabout your niece!- But I did warn you.- Only not enough!I mean, really, how could I know?When you look at a woman, you only seethe facade, not what's inside her.Isn't that so, monsieur?Are you married?- No, no.- You're in luck!- Hey, Armand, take your hand away!Who likes to see a gendarme's handon their shoulder?Yes, that's true. I'm sorry.- To your health, Albert.- And yours!- Oh, hello, Cesar!- Don't you say hello to Armand?- Yes! Hello, Armand!- Tell them to set the table for four.- Four?- Of course.

What is it??- You must be crazy!- You're scared, Henri!Not only do you keep him here,but you introduce him to Armand!Don't you realize it would be best ifhe spends all day with Armand?!What did you tellArmand about him?That he's an old friend from Morocco,His name is Albert.He has a truckload of sheep.He comes from Lyon.As for the rest, all you've got to dois keep quiet. Is that clear?But that's it, I tell you,She broke everything!- Now I understand your nervousness.- You don't say!- Cigar?- No, thank you.No, she doesn't like that.- Who?- Mathilde.- Did she cheat on you?- No, she's faithful.- What then?She's nervous. She broke everything.Broke everything? Like what?Everything.Everything that can be broken.Mind you, I don't care.She bought the aquarium herself.And the pendulum clockis from her mother.In any case, it never worked.- Come on, because of a clock...But it's the noise! And the neighbors...The wives of my colleagues must havehave heard everything through the wall.And the inevitable gossip!- Scared to slap her a couple of times?- What?- Back and forth.- Mathilde?!- Right.I can't do that, monsieur.I'm a gendarme.- Yes, sorry, I forgot.- No, I'm the one who's sorry.I'm not such great company today.Come on, it's no big deal.It's normal,when a person has problems...What a nice friend you have!You see, a trucker and a gendarmecan get along quite well!I could ask for nothing more.Of course, men always agreewhen it comes to women.Well, what did you decide about her?- I left.- For good?- No! Well... for one day.A furlough...I came to see...if you'd be willing to talk to her.Look, I don't want to interfere,but at a time like this talking isn't...Either you're a man - and you break everything,or you're a gendarme - and you forgive and forget.You think it's that easy?Well, I'll take my leave.It was nice to meet you...You're not going to leave now, when Ifinally meet someone who understands me?- Yes, but I have sheep to tend to...- So? You've got them in the shade.You see, your friend needs you,just like you may need him.Me? A gendarme?!Why? Do you have somethingagainst gendarmes?No...

Leave his truck alone.It's in the shade!Oh, well...It's the job, right?The same with me.Whenever I seesomeone, my first thought is:\"What illegal things did he do?\"Hey, I'm right here in front of you.- Where are you going?- I'm not hungry anymore.But you're my friend! You can't deceiveanyone with a face like yours.You know what, Armand?I'm starting to like you, too.You know, a real friendisn't easy to find.Therefore, if found...I need to talk to youabout Mathilde!Talk, my pal, talk about Mathildeas much as you like. I'm listening.Anything is better than talkingabout politics...- You know women, Albert...- Well, let's not exaggerate.Yes, yes, I'm sure you do.There isn't much to know.Women, let me tell you,are like... a rat trap!It smells good,looks appetizing...and all you have to dois take a piece of lard and... Bam!And be careful with the latch.That's it.It's just that you've gone so farwith Mathilde that the latch...Yes, of course,with Mathilde, it's a little late.I should become an officer.Barbara!Barbara!What's taking you so long to open?No one asked for me?- No one.Did anyone come here?- Were you expecting someone?- I wasn't. But maybe you were?Your Kopetsky isone of the 3 fugitives.I know.You know?How could you possibly know that?He came to see me.And where is he?If you think I hid him, you only need tosearch the house from attic to basement.And when you're done...I'll tell you what happened.- What happened?- Search first, or you won't believe me.- What did he want?- To see me.Does that surprise you?Did he touch you?Tell the truth, did he touch you?!- He came for his money.- And what did you tell him?I told him I no longer had it.Did you say who took it?And why did the old fool take it?Ah, you must have had funtalking about the old man!Did you make fun of me?!- He doesn't know you.Well, he will know who I am!I swear he will!I'm going to findthat dirty little scoundreland show himwhat I'm capable of!Tell me right now where he went,you hear?!Maybe you think he lefthis address for you?For me, no. But for you, yes,so you can join him.I'm not going with him,and he knows it.How does he know that?Because I told him myself.- What did you tell him?- That I don't love him anymore.Is this true?Did you really tell him that?I've never asked you to believe me,have I?I believe you. Yes, I do!I want to believe you with all my might!You don't love him anymore!Did you say that? Say it again.You said you don't love him anymore?!You can't deny it now, Barbara.Just wait and see!You'll see how good I can be.I have to deliver one of my photos.But I'll be back!Wait for me and you won't regret it!I want you to look beautiful!Beautiful, you hear?Thank you... Ah, thank you!Thanks for sticking around!When he returns,the house will be empty.It would be terrible for him.I almost feel sorry for him.He should have searched the house,as he was about to do.He would have found me,and I would have had to kill him...It would have been a better way outfor him than what awaits him tonight.Tonight, tomorrow andthe day after tomorrow.And every night...The nights I had to spend with him,I could never......forget nor forgive myself.And you wouldn't be able to either.And you? Would you be able to forgetthat I killed a man?Do you want me to tell you why I did it?- No!I don't want to know that.Listen, Armand, you're beginning topiss me off with your officer shtick!Maybe you shouldkick her in the ass, that's all.- I can't! I'm a gendarme!- Then you should slap her sometimes.Believe me, it won't hurt.- I don't want to!- I know, I know. You're a gendarme.- Yes, I'm a gendarme!- Everyone knows that.- Yes, I am a gendarme!They don't let youdo much in the police.Not much...- Listen...- Yes...You...Have you ever triedto take her for a walk?- For a walk?- Mm-hmm.A little walkat night up on the rocks......and then one push...!And Mathilde...will slip.And this is what you're telling me,Albert, my friend?!Look, I was just kidding!You can't joke about such things!You're my friend, Albert!Okay, okay.We mustn't lose sightof each other!We'll see each other again.- Is that what you want, too?- Yes, why not?- Sometime on Sunday.- Yes.I'll wear civilian clothesso nobody bothers me.

She is well.The rich Maharaja said,take everything I have.You can use me as your squire.And the Son of the North,Toomas by name, said to them,I want none of your riches, for I ama thousand times richer than you.I have woods in the north,and wild geese flying over them.When the wind caressesthe golden ears of corn,it feels as it was the sea swelling.And we have the sunthat shines even at midnight.Who's shouting there?Milla, if you should ever wantto become my missus, do it now.Have you ever heardthe squealing of hungry pigs?Hush!

Shall we change the mood?I went out of mood as soon as I saw you.It is my birthday.-When? -Yesterday.Why didn't you tell me?I came to know only now.After seeing my sister's letter.Better late than never.-I wish you many happy returns. -Thanks.You love cameras.So I have bought a camera and binocular for you.-Take. -Thank you.My golden princess, shall we go in my Aeroplane?My dear lover, will you drive straight without looking sideways?Nobody will disturb us here.We will go there.I have taken prints and switched on the lights.Come to your senses.When did you switch on the light?Just now. Your eyes were closed. Not mine.The revolutionary poet Bharathithadasan saidThe real world can be seen only in darkness.Now I understand why you both wanted to come to thisdark room where I take prints.No. Do not make me shy.You can love.But do not display it in any place.A hotel is a place meant to have food.But can you eat food in all the hotels?Stop lecturing. Show me the photo.I have developed it. Look. it is like a pose from a movie.It is very nice. Isn't it?-What do you want, dear? -Brother, I want a camera.It is urgent.Are you going to click photoor are you going to click photos with someone?I am not going to take photo with someone like my friend Vijaya.-She is here. -Oh no!I expected you to come here.-How? -My sister is a dog.I mean, she snoops around like a dog.But I will sniff only the guilty.-Give me camera. -Here it is.-Vijaya's camera is here. Take it. -Thank you. Bye Viji.I will also come with you.Stop gazing at her. Be free at least once in a day.Your sister is very naughty.She has my genes.Why don't you find a groom for her?I have already found. His name is Raghavan.He is in Coimbatore. I am waiting for him to complete his education.You also shift your photo studio to that place.Of course I will. She is my only sister.I will shift my studio to her city after her marriage.What about your marriage with Vijaya?First let her become a lawyer.Please sit.What happened? Did you get the money?No.Didn't you get?Why sir?We have taken loan against this housefor your sister's education. Isn't it?Now they are not ready to give further loan.Then?I did not lose heart. I asked many people known to me.But I did not get.Why don't we and sell the house to the creditor?You have sold the land from which you were getting foodgrains.Now the only property that you have is this house.No sir. My sister is my only permanent treasure.If her education is stalled in the final year because of lack of moneyall my efforts will go in vain.Do not hesitate. Material things are not permanent.It is not wrong to sell them.House is in my name.I request that my sistershould not know this matter for the time being.Why? What will you do if your sister asks money later?God will take care of that.You take care of the present situation.Arrange the documents.Alright. See you.Got the books. Take this.-Viji! -Viji. We have come.Let us go for a picnic.We cannot go later because we have to study for exams.This is the last chance.I will not come. You go.Shankar is also coming with his friends.But he did not tell me.We came to know only now.You are acting like a small kid.Keep quiet.Where are we going?A new garden has been inaugurated recently.-Is it? -We can enjoy.Alright. I will inform sister.Write now. Go. Quick.Dear sister, this letter is from your sister Vijaya.I am good. I received your money and letter. Thank you.I and my hostel friendsare going for a picnic this weekend.Since we have to pass through our villageI would like to come and meet you with my friends.Alas! Then..We are coming on Sunday and returning immediately.My salutations to sir.Rest in person.Your dear sister, Vijaya.I thought Vijaya will come back only after her exams.So I have sold the house and I am staying here.I thought I can explain her this later.Shankar.You lied to us that we are going to Mahabalipurambut have brought us here. Now I know why you did it.Have we come for picnic to see your lover?Your lover has also come.My village is nearby. We are going to see my sister.-Will you accompany us? -No.I cannot leave my friends and come with you.-Then bring them also. -That is more dangerous.It is not right to go as couples to a village.They have come.Your friends have come. You go to your home-town.Bye.Where is your lover?She has flown away.Let us go.You all wanted to meet my sister.See her now. She is my sister.She is like my mother, father, brothers.She is my soul, body and property.No. My sister is everything to me.-Vijaya! -Sister.Vijaya!-Sir, are you fine? -Yes. I am good.-Banu. -Yes.Sir writes letters to me on behalf of my sister.He connects us through the letters.-Greetings sir. -Greetings.Who are you?We have come recently to this village.Yes. Janaki said that you all are coming here.We came to meet you.That is good.I have brought chocolates and biscuits for you. Eat.I do not want this. I have prepared a feast for you.-All of you come. -Come.The food was excellent.We have never tasted food like this.She is right.Sister, all of you stand together. I will take a photo.Sir, you also stand.No. I feel shy.Catch her. Do not allow her to go.-Please come. Stand here. -Why do you feel shy? Stand.-Ready... -Wait.Yes. Click now.The light is pricking my eyes.Now I will stand with my sister. Banu, take.My exams will be over next month.I will surely pass in 1st class and become a lawyer.That is my only wish.I would like to practice under a senior lawyer instead ofwasting time till my results are out.He has also agreed. What is your opinion?I have no objection. Do as you wish.Shall I come here once after my exams are over?No. You have to see me only after you become a lawyerwearing the convocation dress.You should concentrate on your studies till then. Okay.Vijya praises you a lot.Now we are convinced that it is true.Every girl should have a sister like you.Sister, we will go now.Bye sister.-Sir, we will take leave now. -Bye sir.Bye sister.Sir, I will go now.-Sir, I will go now. -Bye.Sir, you have saved me.-Thanks a lot. -Get up.You gave us an opportunity to see areal bondage between two sisters.We should be thankful to you.May you live long!Let me go now.Talk to your sister about us and write me letter. Okay?Okay.-Okay. -Okay.Sister!Sister!Who are you?Who are you?I am the caretaker of this house.Sir and madam have gone out.Where is sister?Are you the sister of the owner of this house?She doesn't stay here.She has sold the house and is staying in another place.Has my sister sold this house?!Where is my sister now?Her place is in the street corner.Sister!-Sister. -Vijaya.Vijaya.Vijaya, have you come back?Have you come? Vijaya...-Vijaya. -Sister.-Sister. -Vijaya...Vijaya.Vijaya.Sister.You underwent so many sufferingsto see me in this dress.Now see me as per your wish.Look at me.Have you become a lawyer?Have you become a lawyer?Yes. I have become a lawyer.O God!O God, you have fulfilled my wish. My sister has become a lawyer.My dear parents,you left her in my lap when I was a child.I brought her up, gave her education and made her a lawyer.I have made her a lawyer.Mother, bless her.-Father, bless her. -Sister!You are like a candle that sacrificeditself for the sake of giving light to my life.You are my God. You should bless me first.May you lead a good life!Sister!-Sister. -Vijaya.You sold our ancestral home to give me educationand are staying in this hut now.Why did you hide this from me?I would have told you before. But...I would have stopped studies and came running to you.That is why I did not tell you about it.When did you sell the house?5-6 months back.Did you sell after I came here with my friends?No. Before that.I can understand now.You did not want to degrade me before my friends.So you begged the people who bought the house,stayed in the house and gave us feast.-Am I right? -Why are you asking?Why are you staring at me like this?How am I going to repay you?I am indebted to you since the day I was born.This one birth is not sufficient to repay my debt.I have to take many more births for it.I just wish God helps me to do it.Do not talk nonsense.Your affection for me has turned you into God for me.And it has turned me mad.We will live together for many more births.I don't care about the lost house.You are now a lawyer. It is like a treasure for me.Before going to court for the 1st time for arguments,I will come to you for your blessings.Only then I will succeed.You will always be victorious.Because, even as a child, you used to tell me that oneshould be impartial while upholding justice.That is why I am certain.I will be hiding somewhereand feeling happy looking at you, when you first speak in the court.Come with me to Madras tomorrow.O God! Should I come with you?What work do you have here now?-Vijaya! -Yes sir.Your sister has done all that you needed, till now.Now we should perform her marriage.Sir...Yes. Sir is right.Sir, have you thought something about sister's marriage?Of course. I have tried many times before this.But she was not willing to marry till you finish your education.Now your education is over. I have also planned something.What is it?I heard there is a groom in Coimbatoreand he wants a girl to marryI have written to my friend.After getting his reply, I will go and speak about it.Sister has to be alone here till then.Were you staying with her till now?I will not die before performing my daughter's marriage.Find a good groom for her.Good...I am ready to marry the person you choose.Alright.Do not just sit here and talk. You have a job.You should go back.Yes. I forgot about it. I will start now.Hey, you were dealing in vessels made of lead.Why do you want to run a photo studio?Nowadays people use steel and plastic vessels.So I have left my earlier job and want to work here.Sir...Why are you shouting?-I was not shouting. -Was just worried about something.You are neither a man nor a girl.Why are you behaving like this insulting me in public?What can I do for that? What can you do?You know only to laugh.Why are you standing before my shop early in the morning?All of us took photo in this studio.But he did not click it properly.Do not blame the photo. Your face is like that.I did not mean that. He has interchanged our photos.Why are you doing like this?He has spoiled the good reputation of your studio.Why did you sell your studio to such people?I advised him while selling that he should earn a good name.But he has spoiled it.-Did you name me? -Shut up.Number the negatives correctly.Only then you can give the correct one and there will no mistakes.-Okay. -You may go now.Come after three days and collect it.Do not stand in the same pose.I am used to holding milk vessel.Do not hit me.I have to do something so that you will change.Come with me.-Stop there. -Who is that?-Brother! -Are you my brother?I was struggling to become an actor since many years.But I did not get any role.So I have now dressed up as king and come here.You foolish king, I am not the owner of the shop now.It is transferred in his name.I have sold this studio and I am going to start a new onein Coimbatore because my sister is getting married there.O king, I can take good photos.No. I want my photo to be clicked by you.I do not want him to take.-Please take my photo also. -Please take mine.Why are you pestering me to take photo?You are the reason for this.The board is still in my name. You have not changed it.Nobody will come if I remove the board.Do you want me to stay here?Teach me the job and then go.Since all of you are requesting me, I will take just one photo.All of you sit in a group.You have to take individually.I will take together and then separate it. Go and sit. Fast.Go.Now smile.Is this the way to smile?You keep your mouth closed. I will click the photo.See here.King, look here.I have taken.I have sold the photo studio but do not know how theperson is going to manage.May God help him!Why did you sell it to him?I did not get any other buyer.Okay. You post these invitations.I will give to my friends in person.I will also meet Vijaya.Raghavan. Sweet name.Is the marriage being performed in Coimbatore?Yes. In bridegroom's house. He is my uncle's son.He has set up a studio for my brother thereand asked him to stay there.Very good. Your brother is luckier than you.There is one more special thing in this marriage.What is it?Your lover, engineer Shankar stays in Coimbatore.So he is going to preside over the marriage.-Is it? -Yes.Our friends are also attending.But I will not compel your to come.Because I know though you stay in Chennai,your heart is in Coimbatore.My marriage will bring you both together.Congratulations.I was considering my sister as mine.But she is married now. She will be yours from now.It is your responsibility to seethat she is happy throughout her life,instead of only smiling for the photo.Shankar!Shankar!Have you slept so soon?Vijaya! Vijaya!Vijaya, what happened? Why did you scream?See there. A person strangled a girl and killed her.Come. Let us go and see.In this place?Yes. It is the same place.But no one is here.I saw just now. How did they vanish so soon?May be the killer saw me and so he ran away with the dead body.Why are you laughing?You are imagining things after reading many criminal books.No. I really saw it.After some time, you may call me a murderer.-Now get out of this place. -You may think so.But I cannot forget the terrible murder scene that I saw.One day I will surely see the murderer.I will definitely hand him over to the police.I will also help you then. Now let us go to my house.No. I am disturbed. I also have a hearing tomorrow.I have to go.I will surely come to your house next time.Okay. As you please.-Greetings. -Please take your seat.This gentleman is the person who wrote about the marriage proposal.-Salutations. -Greetings.-Did you eat anything? -Yes.Sir is a famous Judge.My name is Sundaram.I want to tell you a few words about the girl.Okay. Tell.The girl is from a village.No problem.She is illiterate.That is not an important issue.She is extremely poor.No problem.Sir...She has only one younger sister.She sold her entire propertyto educate her sister and to make her a lawyer.Is it? May God bless her!I have been waiting to marry a girl like her.I remained a bachelor because I wanted a girlwho will take care of my brother affectionately,like my dead mother.Beauty, status, education or money is not needed for that.To tell you frankly, I want my wife to be like a walking God.People say that a husband's feelings should be arousedwhen he looks at his wife.But for me I should feel respect for my wife.Look at the girl's photo.-What is her name? -Janaki.Fix the marriage date.What about the formalities?I do not need any pomp or show.Sir, my father was an estate owner.He had lots of property.Still he married a girl from a simple family.My father followed the principle that people whohave everything must help the have-nots. Even I follow it.So I want my marriage to take place in a simple manner.The marriage expenses will be borne by me.Varada, bring the almanac.Excuse me.The girl wants the marriage to take place in her village.Is it? Very convenient. The marriage will be a simple affair.Sir, take.Then...No need to talk further. Choose a date.Are you marrying without my knowledge?How can it happen?She is going to be your sister-in-law. How is she?She looks divine.In these days when people are selfish and refuse to help others,here is a person who has offered to marry you.Do you think this happened because of us?It is God's will. It is due to your kind heart.You have got a good husband and a good life.May you lead a good life!-Sir! -What is the matter?Got a call from printing press. The marriage invitation is ready.They are asking when you can go there.Tell them I will go now and take it.Alright sir.I wonder whether the photographer from Madrasis taking photographs or casting some magic spell?People are thronging to his studio. I feel jealous.Jealousy is like the cigar you smoke. It burns itself.Who gave him the title of 'photo specialist' Raju?Has he conferred it on himself?He is boasting. He was taking photos of corpses in Madras.I know about him.He got his married here and started the business.People are crowding to his studioWhat is special about his photo?His photos are colourful.I wonder if he is applying some paste on the photos!How is he able to take such beautiful photos?Our camera is not good. People look older in this.Father, I will go and learn his art in a cunning way.It is an insult for me if he knows that you are my daughter.I have come from the village now. He doesn't know me.Shall I go?Be careful.Come here.Why are you entering in a sly? What do you want?Is the boss inside the dark room?Why should the boss always be in the dark room?Shouldn't he come out in the light?Even you have come from the dark room.Have I come from the dark room?! You are blabbering.I am not blabbering.All of us come out from the womb of their mother,which is dark, after ten months.It is dark room. Am I right?-Is it? -Yes.Don't I look like a boss?-Are you the boss?! -Look at my wound.Does the boss have a wound?Yes. Workers and employers always fight with each other.Workers asked for Diwali bonus which I refused to give.I got hurt and this is the wound.I do not pay bonus for 'Pongal' festival also.That is why my business is improving.What sort of photo do you want? Which size and in what pose?From head to toe.-Full size? -Yes. Then from head to hip.Don't you want me to take photo above this?No sir. Click each part separately.Normally people take full size photo and see part by part.But you want to be taken in parts and then see the full sizeSir, people say that you are efficient in taking photosof individual body parts.Who said? Did the opposite side photo shop owner say?How do you know?He is a chatter box. He is only capable of running a tea shop.Did you drink tea in his shop?Do not talk about him now.Which size photo do you want?Full plate.Full plate! Is this a photo studio or a hotel?The photo should be huge and it should be attractive.Your photo will not be attractive. It will give a shock.Sir, I want to act in movies.So click a photo in standing posture.You will not get movie chance if you take photo in standing posture.You should take a photo lying down.No.Wow! This is very nice.It is not you. So it is nice.Take only one photo like this.-Are you going to wear half pants? -Yes sir.Go there. You will spoil my reputation. Stand there.Stand.Take a smiling photo of mine.You stand with your mouth closed. I will drag out your teeth!Look here.How do I look?You have fallen down. Get up.Raju, is she your lover?No. She is my customer. I clicked her photo.You come tomorrow. I will keep the photos ready.Shall I go?You are smiling now but were looking serious when I took photo.Marriage invitation.Who is the girl? Vijaya, right?My brother is getting married.He is aged. Why does he want to marry now?I went to your sister's house.Saw your brother-in-law Raghavan and I have giventhe invitation to them.I am going to Madras today by blue mountain express.I can understand. In that way you can meet Vijaya in thepretext of inviting her for marriage and spend some time with her.I think you have done the preliminary work for itYes sirI cannot come for marriage. You know how busy I am.Keep this money for the marriage expense.-No sir. -Never mind. Take it.-Thank you sir. I will go now. -Okay.-Oh! I am angry with you. -I enjoy it.Why did you scare me?Because I cannot scare you after our marriage.I forgot to tell you. My sister is getting married.Is it? My brother is also getting married.I have come to invite you.I want to invite you personally and take you with me.-Is the groom your elder brother? -Yes. Why?My sister is the bride.Very good.Very good.I received letter from sister now.I am leaving now for my home-town.Let us talk about our marriage to them after their marriage.They will...If they oppose it...We have to plead with them.-Sister! Sister! -What is the matter?Why are you kicking me while taking photo?You are a short tempered man.Afterwards you will say that nobody invited you in the marriage.If they had performed the marriages ofboth the brothers and sisters on the same day,they could've saved expense and it would have been convenient for us.What are you saying?A Judge is getting married.Instead of performing the marriage in a big city likeCoimbatore or Madras, they are celebrating it in a village.Most of the guests are villagers with unkempt hair and dhoti.I do not like to take such photos.-Greetings sir. -Do not disturb me.Greet the guests.The Judge's brother is an engineer.But he wants to marry in the construction site.They should marry in a proper place.Instead they want to convert the place they choose,into a marriage hall.I will take care of the arrangements here.You go to the groom's place and take care of them.I am coming from there.He doesn't look like a groom.He looks like a musician who plays Nadaswaram.I requested him to smile for the photo.But he stared at me rudely.I am scared of him. So I came here running.Where is Shankar?He is with his brother. He is the best man for the groom.I clicked his photo.-But the photo has not come out. -Why?There was a problem with the camera and I opened it.You take your own photographs.This is the 3rd time it is happening.-Where is Vijaya? -She is dressing up her sister.I will take photo.They are dressing up.It is not proper to take photo now.My neck is paining. How long will you take? Is it not over?You are going to be the wife of a famous Judgeand you are the sister of a junior lawyer.People will mock at you for being unsophisticated.That is why I am changing your get up.O God!Stop these mannerisms.If you behave like this in Coimbatore,the people there will make fun of you.See how you look now.-Are you feeling cold? -No.Then why are you covering yourself?Others can see my neck.Don't you want others to see the jewellery you are wearing?Am I wearing jewellery for that reason?For what else are you wearing?I am wearing because it will be useful in times of need.Do not say this to your husband because the personyou are going to marry is not a smoker or gambler.He is a Judge. He is the upholder of the law.I would like to tell you something.Tell me.I know his brother. He works as an engineer.Is it?! Come. Let us go and see the groom.No. I will not come.I will go and see.Sister!Sister!Vijaya!-Sister! -What happened?Sister, do not marry this person.Why?The person who is going to marry you is a murderer.Vijaya!Yes. He is a murderer.-Do not blabber. -I am saying the truth.I saw him throttling a girl's neckand killing her when I had been to Coimbatore.Now I can understandwhy he arranged to marry my sister in a haste.He fears that I will pinpoint him.That is why he avoided engagement function-and wanted to marry directly. -Shut up.Are you that murderer's brother?I cannot believe that the person who killed a girl is your brother.I am not able to digest it.What nonsense? Are you mad?No. I am speaking with a sound mind.I remember the face well.It was your brother.Why didn't you tell this before?I am seeing your brother only now.What is the proof that it was my brother whom you saw?-What? -What is the proof?My eyes are the witness to it. My heart is the witness.Your heart and eyes are defective.It is my feeling that you are confused.No! No!Sister, stop this marriage.You have helped me a lot.But if you stop the marriage, it will be the greatest help to me.Stop the marriage for my sake.I am prepared to do anything for you.But think about this.Will I get married again if this marriage is stalled?Will anybody else marry me if they know that my marriagewas stopped at the last minute?Do you want me to remain unmarried? Then tell me.I will stop this marriage. I do not mean that.You are an educated girl.You know that marriages do not happen because of our efforts.It happens as per God's will.Marriages are made in heaven.No one can stop it.You are saying just before my marriagethat the person who is going to marry me is a murderer.But many people have turned murderers after marriage.I am ready to face the consequences of this marriage.I will face it.Brother.I request that none, including your brother,should know about this incident.You go and make arrangements for marriage.Please go.Place your right foot forward and enter.Janaki.They are my parents.Shankar!He is my younger brother.From today, it is your responsibilityto make him eat in time.You are embarrassing me.Vijaya!I think you must have come to your senses after coming hereI think you have realized my brother's nature now.I understood it long back. Let us not talk about it.My love for you is pure.It is my sister's ill fate that she had to marry your brother.I wonder how my fate will turn out to be!Vijaya!Shankar!I thank you for welcoming meand allowing me to stay in your house,in spite of rebuking your brother.I will go now.All the best.Vijaya!Vijaya!Your sister is better.Though illiterate, she has the guts to see my face.But you bend your head immediately upon seeing me.Why? Don't you like to see my face?No.She is of shy nature.Like your sister, even I have studied law.I started as a lawyer and have become a Judge now.I can study a person's face.I observed on the marriage day itselfthat your sister is worried and unhappy.Why Vijaya.Are you not happy with this marriage?Not like that.Vijaya.You both should not talk.I am asking Vijaya and she has to answer it.Tell me. Tell.Vijaya. You are a young lawyer.You must be eloquent and energetic.But if you are quiet like this,how are you going to argue in the court?No. You are a misfit for the profession.No. You are thoroughly wrong.I am absolutely fit for this profession.-I appreciate you. -I am worthy of it.I know it. But you have still not answered my question.Do you want to know whether I do not like youor I am not interested in my sister's marriage?Yes. You are perfectly right.Vijaya. Why are you crying?Nothing.I am aghast that my illiterate and innocent sisterfrom a village has got a husband like you.Too much of exaggeration. You are praising me a lot.I am going back to my place.Why should you go so soon?You can stay here for a few more days.No. I have to help my senior for a case tomorrow in Madras...Do you want to sit down? Are you not ashamed?Sit after removing your moustache.But now act like a man and stand.Do not be a hen packed husband.Keep the hand on the shoulder.I told you keep your hand on her shoulder.Take it.I told you to click photo.Thank God!Are you praying?!No. I want the finger rings to be seen on the photo.Cover your face. They will be seen properly.Remove your hand. Idiot!I am taking your photo. Smile.Dear, if we had brought our pet dog,it would have posed for the photo. Isn't it?One is enough. Why do you need two dogs? Stand properly.Did you take the balance cash from the bus conductor?You bought the ticket. Will he give the balance to me?Yes. I asked for two tickets to photo shop. He also gave me.He asked who the other person isand I said that it is me and my wife.He asked me to identify my wife.-What did you say? -I said you are my wife.Of course, I am your wife.Why are you hitting me in the photo shop?Shut up.-Wait. I have lost my money. -Get up.Hand.On her shoulder.That is right. Look here.Over. Take off your hand. Come here.How much advance should we give?-Pay five or ten rupees. -Shall I give now or later?-Give later. -How many copies will you give?-Three copies. -I want eight copies.Then go to the opposite shop. Here I will give only three copies.Give me two copies and display one copy in your shop.Don't you want my business to do well?Why are you asking me to display your face in my shop?Alright. Wash the photo and give.I will wash with a scented soap. Don't worry.Take her and leave the place.Dear! -Come.-Come dear. -She is dominating him.Is he a real man?!I had switched on the light. Now it is off.Thief. Come here. What have you taken?Solution bottle! How dare you steal it?That...Have you really become mad because you did not get a chance in cinema?Am I mad? Am I mad?Yes. You are mad.No. I am not mad.Father! It is dangerous to leave your hand.Come in. Go in.-Sir, please open the door. -No.-You are a mad girl. -I am not mad. Father!Hello, how are you?I came to enquire about your business.You are my opponent. Why have you come here?Do you want to spoil my business?We both are in the same profession.I was working in the dark room when I heard a sound in your shop.What is the matter?Father!Shut up. Is he your father?His business is already dull.If he has a mad girl like you as daughter,he has to close his photo business and beg.Who is this girl? Why have you locked her up?-She is a movie buff. -Movie buff!What sort of movies is she crazy about?She is a crazy girl. The other day she wanted meto clean the photo and give immediately after taking it.And today she entered the dark room and stole the solution.What is the connection between her and solution?Yes.Bright prints... Shining photo.Did you hear? She says 'bright printsExcuse her and send her out.She may tear her own clothes.And may meet with a lorry accident while running on roadWhat are you going to do by locking her up?I will not do anything. Let her stay for three days.Her parents will come in search of her and take her.Otherwise I will send her to mental asylum or police station.But you are busy with your business. How can you handle her.Leave her responsibility to me. I will take care.You do not strain at this old age.Her father must be a fool to have let her go free.-I meant her father. -Father!Since you have grey hairs, she is calling you 'father'.Solution thief. Keep quiet.Father!She is calling me out of affection.She is not calling out of affection.A nail must have got stuck in her leg. So she is jumping.-You go and mind your business. -What business can I do?You have taken away my five year old customers.Then how can I work?I have now decided to set up a tea shop.You were running a tea shop before. Right?You can do it. Set up a tea shop. I will come and drink.Child, do not be scared of anyone or anything.Your father will come and take you.Let her father come. I will tell him he is an idiot.I will get angry if you scold him.-Get lost. -I will go now.Why is he affectionate towards this girl?He fondled her before going.In spite of knowing that Shankar and Vijaya loveeach other, you have hid the matter from me.You...Brother, you know about it now. Don't bother.Serve me Rasam.Rasam is very tasty.Drink it. I do not want to finish eating the food.Eat slowly.Eating slowly increases the longevity.I want to live for hundred years to eat the food prepared by you.You have turned him into a foodieYou are the real foodie,I am your brother Sapatulakshmanand she is kitchen queen.Stupid. Her name is Janaki. Do not call her Seetha.Your brother-in-law is calling you by your name.I will not call her by her name. It is wrong.Do not ask for a golden deer, like Sita asked Rama.You ask me. I will get anything that you ask.Brother, in Ramayana,if Lakshmana had gone in search of deer instead of Rama,there would have been no problem.-But we need a story. -I want curry.I was listening to your talk.Sister-in-law is like a mother to me, whom I was longing for.I pray that she leads a good life.I wanted you to say this.That is why I waited so long and married a girl like her.Both of you are wrong.I have lost way and fallen into heaven.You call yourself an unsophisticated villager.But you are tying the knot well.What do you mean?I meant the shoe lace that you tied now.It is not a big issue.When I was a child,I used to tie my hair with flowers with a banana fibre.Education and culture are different.Education is acquired but culture is inborn.You are a very cultured lady.Whatever I heard is right.What is that?Husband praises his wifewhenever he gets an opportunity when they are newly-wed.Don't worry. I will praise you till the end.I will bring the coat for you.I am going for dinner. I will late tonight.No problem. I will be awake till you come.That is why I am telling you now.Do not wait for me. You have food.-See you. -Alright.Dear, please wait.Did you see this?He acts as a gentleman in the morningbut behaves cheaply at night.He has the bad habit of drinking and womanizing.Murder is the only thing that he might not have done.He might have done that. Who knows?He is newly married. His wife is a very good lady.Though he holds a high post, his behaviour is cheap.Such rascals do not deserve high posts.We should not spare him.Let us go and complaint to police.Why should we do it?Let us go to his house and inform his wife about him.Let us not get involved with high society people.Like us, many people will come to know about this later.His true colour will be revealed then.Brother!Brother!What is the time now?Is this proper?I had gone for a dinner.We were talking and I didn't notice the time.You were not coming home in time before marriage.You were not eating in time.And there was no one to question you.Now there is someone. I am asking on her behalf.Otherwise I am not bothered about the place you visit orthe time you return home.Have I asked before?-I can understand. -I don't think so.I pity sister-in-law.She was awake and was walking up and down the stairs looking for youAny other person would not have caredand slept in the AC room.Your sister-in-law could have slept. I told her before going.-When did you say? -Yes.Your brother told me.You are supporting your husband.Don't laugh.I say, don't laugh.Sister-in-law gets up before sunrise,works till sunset doesn't have fixed timeto work and walks for miles inside the house in a day.I do not like it if you trouble her again.Okay. I will adjust.No adjustment. You must report to her promptly.Yes sir.What did your brother say?He said he will break my limbs if I behave like this again.Alas! He seems to be a rogue.No. He said, henceforth, I have to come in time and please you.That is good.Janaki.Janaki, where is my pen?Take. I was filling ink in it.Very good.-What? -You have worn it wrongly.I was thinking something else.You are taking care of my daily needs.Now I remember only about the court.You are doing a lot for me.What am I going to do for you?Woman gets satisfactionby doing such duties.How can you fix a price for it?Well said. You speak well.Who taught you this?I am not a lawyer like my sister.Now I remember. I wanted to write a letter to her.I forgot.Will you write it for me?I am very sorry. Forgive me.I have work. Take my brother's help. Bye.-Brother. -Sister-in-law.-Brother. -What is it?Why are you crying?I am reminded about your support for mewhile talking to your brother yesterday.You have brought some discipline to this houseand are like a God here.How can I stay without praying to you?No. Do not use such big words.The person looking at the temple tower knows its value.God created brother in place of fatherand you in place of my mother.I am ready to shed blood for my brother.And I am prepared to give my life for your sake.Brother.I am spellbound.I am unable to speak.-Can you do me a favour? -Tell me.I want to write letter to Vijaya.-What are you going to write? -You write. I will say.Come.-Sit. -No problem. I will stand.Okay. You say. I will write.What is the problem?-I feel shy. -Why should you feel shy?You are writing letter to your sister.Dear lawyer sister,Only sister will do.Okay. Dear only sister,I am your sister writing.Wait. I and him i.e., your lover...Who is that lover?The person writing the letter.Do I have such a title? Very good. Tell me.I am happy and comfortable here. -Yes.I only wish that you are near me to see it and be happy.I wish that you also get married to a good family like mine.I pray that all girls get it.My husband and your lover enquired about you.Reply soon. Over.Reply. Over.Shall I write one sentence if you permit me?Why not? Write a lot.Have you come to take your daughter?Daughter!Who are you?He is calling you daughter. He is your father.My daughter, do not spoil my honour.Get out. You are not my father.Sir, he is a rogue. He is trying to kidnap me.Sir, she refuses to accept her father.Why are you fighting?Mad girl. The other day you called Kupusamy,the opposite shop owner as father.Today your real father has come. But you refuse to acknowledge him.-Take her. -She is refusing to come with me.-Beat her. -Daughter, observe me properly.You sinner, how dare you wink at me?Rogue, how dare you wink at me?-I will thrash you. -I am really your father.Get out.You...Father!You sinner! Is it you?You are a cheat who came to spoil my business.You look like a vagabond in sari.You cheat! You came to my shop to steal.You also wasted my money by eating at your will.I will hand over both of you to police now.-Son-in-law! -Why call me your son-in-law?I lost my livelihood and business because of you.Please marry my daughter.How can I become a son-in-law suddenly?I will come and ask for your hand.Keep her as your assistant for a few months.She will work hard.-My child! -Yes.-Do you like him? -He has a beautiful face.I clicked his photo with my eyes beforehe clicked my photo with his camera.I have enlarged it in my heart.Now I am ready to marry him.I am going to marry your daughter. Leave me.Wear sari properly.-Sir! -What?I went to your sister's house.Policemen came and arrested your brother-in-law.-Police! -Yes.Your sister wants you to go there immediately.Is it? Alright. You take care of the shop.You take care of my wife.My sweet heart Viji, well and wish the same there.Somebody has poisoned your mind by speaking ill of mybrother and you believe it.I hope at least after seeing your sister's letter,you will realize that he is a good man.If you visit my house to see your sister, even I can meet you.Or else, if you like, I will come there and see you.Shankar.Sister.Your brother is double-faced.You are seeing only one side of his nature.I will not believe that murderer.Vijaya, some glad news.What sir?When you went to Coimbatore, you said-you saw a murder being committed. -Yes sir.Then after returning from your sister's marriage,you said that your sister is married to that murdererand you are going to take action against him.-You are right. -What did I reply to it?I said that police will question you and will tell you musthave reported the murder on the same day you saw it.I also said that you do not have proof if they ask for it.So I told you not to get involved in it.It was good that I stopped you then.Otherwise the judge would have taken action against you.Why sir?-Did you see today's paper? -No sir.Police have arrested the murderer.He got married recently.See his photo.It is injustice.He is my friend Banu's husband.I had attended their marriage.It is a sham.Read the full matter. I will attend the phone.It is atrocious. Why should an innocent man be punished?No. Injustice should not prevail.I will prove that Banu's husband is innocent and save his life.Vijaya, you are crazy.If you have to prove that your friend's husband is innocentyou have to confirm that your sister's husband is guilty.Are you going to punish your sister's husband becauseyou want to save your friend's husband?Tell me.No. I forgot that this will affect your life.You have forgotten that you are a lawyer.Do you remember the oath you took during the convocation ceremony?I will protect the integrity of the profession and will not misuse it.You have forgotten the promise you madeand are now bound by your attachment to your sister.Are you trying to kill justice?Are you going to hide the truthbecause he is your sister's husband?Then you will be the murdering justice.Answer me, Vijaya. Tell me.No. I will never act against law.I will not act.Vijaya, I struggled a lot to bring you to this position.I have prayed to God for your good.I had lot of affection for you.But now you are going to act against my husband.Is it right?Are you going to earn the reputation of a good lawyerat the cost of my life?You will be blamed for not showing your gratitude to me.Tell me. What do you want to do?Sister...You always fought for justice but now you have become soberbecause it concerns your sister.Why?You were witness to a horrible murderbut now an innocent person is being accused of it.How can you continue to be a lawyerif your friend's husband is punished for it.Do you deserve to lead such a life?You are a girl and have proved that by falling for your sentiments.Vijaya. You are a girl. Affection is important to you.No. Justice is important to you.No, Affection is important.No. Justice is God. Law is your life and soul.Justice is life.O God!What shall I do now? What shall I do?Truth is victory.It is alright.-Sir. -What?I am going to argue in court on behalf of that innocent person.Do you still say that you are right?Yes sir.Witness?My conscience.Proof?I am going to Coimbatore now to gather evidence.No other witness is superior to conscience.That conscience is called justice.I pray to God that he give you strength to fight againsta snake in the form of affection with the help of your conscience.God bless you, my child.I am ready to help you in this case.Thank you sir.Wish you success.Dear, leave me.You are very naughty nowbecause your brother is has gone out of station.-Vijaya! -Sister.Sister, it has been many days since I saw you.You have come after a long time.How are you? Are you fine?Sit and talk to him. I will bring coffee.Please sit.Sit.If you had informed,I would have come in car to station to pick you up.It was decided suddenly. I had to come here for a case.Is it civil case or criminal case?Criminal case.A girl named Shobha was murdered here a few days back.Yes.Police have arrested a person named Raghavan on suspicionthat he is the murderer.I have come to appear on behalf of that innocent man.Very good. Have you come to Coimbatore for this reason?Then Raghavan must be close to you.Yes. Raghavan is the husband of my college mate.I see.I have come here to prove that he is innocent and release himThat is my main aim.Do not think that your sister has come to see you.Then?She has come to attend a case. She also thought she can meet you.Is it true?Yes. it is an important case.Even if the case drags for one year, you have to stay here.What do you say?This is your house. You are the President and I am the peon.Why do you need my permission?Do as you like.Your brother-in-law is very naughty.I would not have worried so much if your husband isgoing to die because of ill health.But if he is going to die because he has beenaccused of a crime which he has not done, I will not allow it.I am your brother. I will support you.My duty starts now.I will save your husband at any cost.I will surely do it.You do not worry about it.-Vijaya! -Banu.Do not cry. It is a challenging time for us.Let us emerge victorious from this.How did you come here?I read the news in paper. I went to your houseand got information that you are here.I have come to meet Mr. Raghavan and know some details.-What do you mean? -Yes. I am your lawyer.I will meet Mr. Raghavan.Truth will triumph. There is someone to help the poor.Do you know Shobha, who was murdered?I know her very well.-How? -I and Shobha were college mates.One day she said that she loves me.I was shocked.I told her, 'I mingled with you like my sister.You are mistaken. Stop having such feelings towards me.But she did not leave me.She started troubling me by writing a love letter daily.I thought it is dangerous if it continues.So I arranged for my marriage.After that, when I heard that Shobha was murdered,I felt very sad.Suddenly one day policemen came to my house to search.At that time they got hold of one of the love letterswritten by Shobha to me.On that basis, they suspected me and arrested me.This is what happened.Does Shobha have any relatives?She has one sister named Asha.Please come.Sit. I will come now.Sorry for the delay.No problem. Who is Asha?I am Asha. Who are you?I am Vijaya, Mr. Raghavan's lawyer.Can you tell me about Shobha, who was murdered?Please say.No. I will not tell. Do not disturb me.-Get out of here. -Please...Get out.Traitor!Steady... Steady...Thank you.One of my three wishes has been fulfilled today.Do you mean greed for land, greed for moneyand this wish to take photo?No. I want a lady to stitch my shirt,a lady to cut my hairand a lady should click my photo.-You have forgotten one more thing. -What is it?Your desire to get beaten by a lady.-Madam. -Who is that?I want to take my photo.-Sure. I will take. -From head to toe.Is it?Enlargement will be as per my wish.Okay. Sit there.Alright.Ready.One minute...Ready...Just a minute.What is he doing?!Ready.Ready.Alas!Dear, a rogue has come to our shop and is creating problem.I wanted to take a photo with my bare body.But this girl got scared.Then you should have gone to a male photographer.Why have you come here?I am already depressed due to my sister's problem.Why did you open the shop?Your business is flourishing.If you want your sister to lead a good life,you should also lead a good life.And I can lead a good life only if your life is good.And I can lead a good life only if your life is good.Correct. My daughter Rani is right.Stop it.I have brought thingsto do a prayer for my sister's husband's longevity.What about my daughter's life?I first want my brother-in-law to be released.Till then you and your daughter should not come here.Take her with you.We will get married after the case ends favourably.You also do prayer.And I will also do prayer from today, to unite you both.Sister, I have brought the things required for prayer.Check if everything is there.Sister, I did not know the importanceof this when I went to buy.But I realized its greatness only while returning.Girls are like a puzzle, difficult to understand.When a girl was ill and was fighting for her life,everyone told her to pray to God for herself.But even at that stage she was worried about her husband,if she dies, and so prayed for him.The life of a girl is in her body but her soul is with her husband.Brother...A girl thinks that her husband ties nuptial thread to herbecause of her beauty.Only when she loses it, she feels for her husband loss.Wait for just one week.Banu, I have some good news for you.What is it?I have a proof to prove that Raghavan is innocent.Is it?! Now don't worry.Justice never sleeps.Because it is scared of itself.It is scared that people may kill it and so remains awake.Why are you worried? Smile.O God!I pray my husband leads a long and healthy life.May you lead a long life with your husband!Get up.Why are you crying?This is the first festival of changing the nuptial chainafter our marriage.These are tears of joy due to the blessings from you.-See you then. -See you.Vijaya.What is special today?Today I am going to argue in the court for the 1st time.You?!Why are you shocked?You told me before that you will take my blessings and gobefore arguing the 1st case so that you will emerge victorious.But today you are going without informing me.Why?No problem.Today is an auspicious day when ladies pray for their husbands.In this first case which you are going to argue...Pray to God that I should lose this.-Vijaya. -Yes. I am telling the truth.Why are you saying so?You are hiding something. Tell frankly.Why should you lose? Why?If I win, you will become sad and worried.Just now you prayed to Godthat your husband should live for hundred years.Now I have taken up that case which is a challenge to that.Vijaya!Sister.Today I am going to argue to release an innocent personand punish your husband, who is guilty.Now tell me.I am now going to argue a casewhich will punish your husband, who is guilty.Can you still bless me to win this case?Tell me. Can you do it?-I can do it. -Sister.My husband is a human God.I believe that he cannot be the murderer.Even God cannot break my belief.If I pray to God that you should win this case,it is a proof that I have lost in my belief.I will bless you with the same vermilion that my husbandapplied to me blessing me a long life with him.-Sister! -Otherwiseit will be proved that my husband is not innocentand he is the murderer.-No, sister. -Wait.Sister.If you think you are indebted to me for educating youyou should not leave this place without taking my blessings.It is my order.Sister.You believe that justice will win.Likewise I also believe that my husband will lead a long life.It is the fight between justice and my husband's life.It is a challenge. Let us see who wins.You fight for justice. Get up.Sister.Like I said before, I will come to court and feel happyseeing you arguing against my husband.You may go.Silence. Silence.June 4th 1967 around 4 p.m. you, Raghavan,you, Raghavan, planned and kidnapped a girl named Shobha.You have been accused ofthrottling her neck with cloth and killing her.Your crime will be punished as per IPC 364 and 302.Mr. Raghavan, what is your reply to the allegationslevelled against you?Judge sir, I am innocent.Mr. Prosecutor,you may start the case.Yes, your honour.Excuse me. I regret to say thatI have to object to your presiding over this case.-Reason? -I am sorry.I think you are involved in this case.I want to question you as an important witness.Vijaya!This is a court.You must be aware that you have to get permission froma higher court if someone else has to preside over this case.I have already applied for it.Alright.I am adjourning the case to 10th.Arrange for order from higher court before that.Vijaya hasn't come?She must be embarrassed to come with us.She may even be sad. She is just a child.We can come to court separately but can go back together.Go and call her.Go and call her.What is happening here? I do not understand.He is not only a Judge. He is your sister's husband.We do not want any confusion in your family because of us.Yes. We will find another lawyer.Did I come because you called me?I will not leave it even if you refuse.I am not fighting for you. I am fighting for justice.Family should not come in the way of justice.I will explain later.Vijaya.Sister.My husband is waiting for you.Come. Let us go home.She had come to me before, for a case, when I was a lawyer.You both started having relationship after that. Right?-No. -Not only that.You loved Asha's sister Shobha also and approached her.It is a lie.Objection your honour.Is this case about Raghavan or about Mr. Sundaram?What is the connection between these two?There is some connection.I am going to prove later that Raghavan is not guilty.I believe this enquiry will help me do it.Objection overruled. Yes. Proceed.Unable to bear your torture, Shobha threatened todisclose your identity.You thought it will be dangerous if she lives.-So you decided to kill her. -No.-You kidnapped her to a particular location. -No.You throttled her neck with clothso that there will be no fingerprints.-No! -Yes. You killed Shobha.Lie. It is a lie.It is shocking!Order. Order.This is a blatant lie. It is an imagination.You are standing with Asha and Shobha in this photo.-Is this a lie? -It is atrocious.Your honour, please look at this photo.Yes. He is Mr. Sundaram.This has already been plannedOn June 4th, the day Shobha was said to have been murdered,I took Judge Mr. Shivaraman along with mewhile going back from court at 4 p.m.I dropped him in his place and then went to my house.I am able to say this with certainlybecause my marriage date was fixed on that day.I have noted it in my diary.I am going to file defamation case against Miss Vijayafor involving me in this murder case,degrading me from the post of Judge,and for accusing me of murder in the pretext of enquiring meas witness and spoiling my social status and family honour.I will make you an accused before that.Objection your honour.This murder case is about Raghavavan.But, because of the cross examination of the defence counsel,it is moving away from that.I request the courtto remove reference of this unnecessary enquiry.I am not noting down anything.I cannot allow you to use the powerto cross examine wrongly.You have to ask only the questions related to this case.No, your honour. What I mean to say is...Case adjourned to Friday.Come. Let us go. Get up.Brother.What is the matter?Vijaya publicly brought you down from the Judge's seat.Why didn't you oppose it?Shankar.I am surprised that you are asking me this.I have to ask because Vijaya told me before thatshe saw a man killing a girl by throttling her neck.When she saw you on the day of marriage,she said you are the murderer and wanted to stop the marriage.But sister-in-law did not allow it.I also stopped her.When she came here after marriage,she was dull because she saw you as a murderer.You also asked her the reason for being grim.Now she has accused you of murder without caring thatyou are a famous judge and her sister's husband.She is becoming authoritative day by day...I am sorry.My belief in you is reducing day by day.Brother!Have you also started suspecting your brother?-I... -I am confident.If it is true that my husband is a judge it isalso true that he is innocent.I am his wife only since few days.I know his nature.But in spite of being his brother and near him for so many years,you have not understood him properly.Sister-in-law.It is alright.Janaki. I will go out for some time.Drink coffee and then go.You also drink.See you.Hello, I am Banu here.-Who is speaking? -Asha.I have some good news for you.I came to know now that your husband did not kill my sister.O God! I will go now and tell.Do not be in a hurry. Nobody will believe if you tell now.If you come to my house at 8 p.m. tonight,I will give all records pertaining to the murderer.We will talk about the further course of action in person.You should come alone. Be careful.Okay.Brother is also not here now. What shall I do?It is only 6 'o' clock now.I cannot wait till 8 p.m.Okay. I will go there and wait.We will be in danger if we let her go.Let us go and catch her.Alas! Accident.Who is this girl?Alas!Thank God. She has only fainted.Who is this girl?Her address is here. I will drop her in her house.Sir, anybody in house?Nobody is here.Madam... What happened to her?She fainted while walking on road.I saw the address in her handbag and brought her here.She has only fainted. She will be conscious soon. I will go now.Who are you sir?Judge Sundaram.Madam.Hello, I am servant Alamelu speaking.I want to speak with Banu regarding the case.Tell her to speak.She is unconscious. Her brother is also not here.Has she fainted! I will come now.Who is that?You? Have you still not gone? Why did you close the door?You sinner!Banu!Alas! Banu!Vijaya!Shankar, come and see your brother.Leave me. Brother.Brother, what are you doing? Brother!Brother, open the door.Brother.Brother.-Banu! -Open the door.Banu!Hello.Hello, is it police station?-Raju! -My sister is dead.Banu is dead.Oh God!Do not cry. What is the use of crying?I do not want to live.I wanted her husband to be released after proving he isinnocent and she can lead a happy life.My sister is dead before it is proved that he is innocent.What shall I do now?We could not save Banu's life.At least let us save her husband's lifeso that she will rest in peace.How? What do you want me to do?I took photo when that sinner killed Banu.-Is it?! -Yes.It is the same person who killed Shobha.His photo is here.Give.Switch on the light.Only the murderer's back is seen.His face is not seen at all.He turned back when I took the photo.That is why only his back is seen.I could not take photographs later.The film is over. This is the last frame.You have lost a good chance.Don't worry. Shankar also was a witness to this murder.Raju, stand still.-Why? -I can see my face in your eyes.Why are you surprised about it? Even my face is seen in your eyes.Eyes are like mirror.Then when the person killed Banu, his face must be there in her eyes.Excellent. Switch off the light.What is this?Alright. We will take necessary action. You may go.Thank you sir.You like to eat this.Yes. It has been many days since I ate this.Take.Good morning, Mr. Sundaram.Mr. Sundaram, I am very sorry.I have come to perform my duty in an embarrassing situation.I am arresting youfor the murder of Shobha, Banu and servant Alamelu.Janaki. Be brave.Vijaya.Console your sister.See you.I do not want anyone to bail me out. I will take care.Inform my brother.Be happy.Mr. Raghavan,as per criminal procedure code sec 494 the public prosecutorhas applied for court's permission to fight this case.I accept the petition and I am releasing you.Thanks a lot.Come. Let us go.Mr. Sundaram, you have been accused of committingtwo cruel murders at the same timeand are punishable under IPC sec 302.What do you want to say about this?I have not committed any crime.I thank you for allowing me to argueand fight my case.Alright.It is possible that two persons can look similar. Isn't it?If that is so, will the voice also be similar?Have you not listened to mimicry?A mimic can make sounds like birds, animals etc.In the same way, I say that the person who looks like mehas practised to speak like me.Do you object this?You accuse me of being guilty.Then why are you staying in my house?I stayed in your house to prove that you are guiltyand to gather evidence for that.Very good. But why should I kill Banu?Banu might have seen you with Asha.You might have got scared that she will give witnessagainst you and so you might have killed her.You also said that you saw me in Asha's house.You were also staying in my house.Why didn't I kill you?You might have attempted it.But I might have been saved by God's grace.I firmly believe that 'dharma' which saved you,will definitely save me also because I am innocent.Say like that. The angel of justice will surely save my husband.Order.Is this a court? What is happening here?A murder trial or family matter?If the audience here interfere,they will be immediately sent out of the court.Yes, proceed.You said Shankar saw Banu's murder.Then he is also a witness.Excuse me. The court has already sent summons to him.But he is missing. Police is searching for him.Is my brother missing?!Do not act. Didn't your brother follow you when you escapedNo. Shankar is in danger. Please save my brother.-Please save Shankar. -Brother!-Brother! -Brother!Silence.Then?That person jumped into the river and started swimming swiftly.At that time I decided that the person is not my brother.He is another person.How?My brother cannot swim.Not only that. He hit me and made me faint.My brother brought me up affectionatelybecause I had lost my parents in a young age.Yes. Proceed.Your honour, my brother is as pure as dew drop.My brother is an upholder of justice like 'DharmaI never expected my brother to face such a situation.I never expected this.What is the relation between you and Sundaram?I am...I am her mistress.When did you get acquainted with Mr. Sundaram?When he was a lawyer, I went to his house for some case.We became close from then.Alright. Still why did he marry another girl?He became a lawyer. He thought it is a disgrace to marry me.So he married some village girl.He as committed these murders.He is a threat to society.So I pray that he be awardedthe maximum punishment of death penaltyas per IPC Sec 302 so that suchevil persons do not live in this society.Then, I took the girl, who had fainted in the road, to her house.My finger prints must have got impressed on that girl that time.I have been accused as guilty on that basis.Your honour, I repeat. I am innocent.I pray that the honourable court release me.Judgment will be pronounced on Monday in this case.He has committed three murders. He cannot escape.He will surely be given death penalty.Vijaya!Vijaya...Why are you crying?Sister.Just as we use a piece of wood to cut the tree,I have spoiled your lifein spite of the fact that you educated me.You are not doing this. It is the power beyond you.Nobody can change the will of God.I told you on my marriage day.I knew that you may have to face this situation in life any time.That is why I told you to stop the marriage.I also told you thatI am ready to face the consequences of my fate.I am repeating it now.Suppose the judgment is against your husband,how can I face you again?I will leave this place before I see you as a widow.I will go away.Stupid.There is something else which I have to do to you.Vijaya, in childhood,I used to perform doll marriage and show to you.Now I want to actually perform your marriage.You go after that.Are you asking me to marry in such a situation?I should definitely perform your marriage in this stage.If you marry later and come to me to take my blessingsI will be a widow. That will not look good.-Sister! -That is why I am telling you to marry now.No. I do not want to marry.No. Forgive me.You are like my daughter.I am telling you this which I haven't told before.I am not your sister. Consider me as your mother.I want to get you married.It is your mother's last wish.I cannot force you if you do not want to fulfil it.Sister!I will perform your marriage as soon as Shankar returns.Do not cry. No use of crying.It is of no use.You!What business do you have here?I came to ask you to forgive me.Why?I know the secret relationship which you and my brother hadIn spite of knowing that my brother can swim,I said he doesn't know in the court.It is because I wanted to save my brother.I think I will succeed in this final effort?What is that effort?After my brother dies of hangingand my sister-in-law becomes a widow,there is no use of the costly jewellery that lies in our cupboard.So I have decided to use that money to make efforts andhelp my brother to escape.Is it?! I understood your nature only now.I thought even you will sacrifice your brotherfor the sake of justice, like Vijaya. Thank God.I will say this now.I have already given the jewellery given to me by your brotherand made arrangements for his escape from jail.Very good.I have also planned to go to some foreign country in achartered flight after he escapes.Wonderful plan.But the plane owner wants Rs one Lakh.I do not have that much money.Do not worry. We have received Rs. Two lakhs fromour estate after selling coffee.All are new notes. I have locked it in my cupboard.I have the key with me.Then you go now and bring one lakh rupees here.Your brother and I will be ready by that time.-Can you do me a small favour? -What?My sister-in-law wants to see my brother.Shall I send her also with you?Oh yes. You go now.You!Didn't you expect me?That...How did you come here?Hasn't my brother told you?He helped me to escape from jail.What? Has your brother helped you escape from jail?He has also made arrangements for us to goby a chartered plane and live in a foreign country in hiding.Hasn't he still come here? Fool. He told me to come.Do not bother about him. Have you forgotten who are you?You are not an ordinary person.You have been conferred a place immediately after God.You should safeguard law for this society.But you have escaped from jail.Isn't it a disgrace for you?Like a gardener stealing from his own farm,you are stealing from your own house. Is this right?Janaki, what is this?I am in a tight situation. I am fighting for life every minute.In the same way I am fighting with my husband's fate and my sister.My sister told me on our marriage day that you are a murderer.Since that day, I am saying that my husband is honestand is innocent. I am fighting a war for justice with her.Now if she knows that you have escaped from jailshe will reprimand me.Forget her. I am asking you.If you have really not committed the murder,why did you escape from jail?Janaki!I am your better half.Tell me the truth at least now.Are you guilty? Are you a murderer? Tell me.Yes. I am a murderer.O God!-Janaki! -Do not come near me.-We are getting late. Start. -No.I will not come and I will not allow you to go.You have escaped from jail but you cannot escape from here.I thought you were innocent all these days.You have ruined that belief.You have already killed three people.Now I will not allow you to kill justice.It is a sin to allow a criminal like you to live in societythough you are my husband.Will you surrender to police or shall I call them?Sister, I said that only your husband is a criminal.But now we know that both brothers are guilty.God has shown you the true nature of your husband.Vijaya!Will you surrender to police now or shall I call them?I will call.Traitor! You are my enemy.-Do not touch her. -Leave me.-Do not touch her. -Leave.You made the arrangements. Why are you coming late?Your sister-in-law doesn't believe me.Only my sister-in-law?What do you mean?I am asking you.-Who are you? -I am your brother.You look like him.Who are you?Tell me.Tell me.Will you not tell?Tell me.Who are you?Say.Tell.Brother, what is happening here?Brother!Tell the truth now.Sister-in-law, Vijaya. He is not my brother.Tell the truth. Who are you?Mr. Shankar.Welcome sir. You have come at the right time.He is Neruppukannaiyan.Remove his gloves from his hand.Sir, do you know him?Yes. He is an old criminal.We were searching for him regarding a case.But we could not get him.Finally we heard he is hiding in a house and surrounded it.But he came to know of it.He burnt the house and escaped from there.He got this wound at that time.Is that the reason you call him 'Neruppukannaiyan'?Yes. To hide his identify from police,he wore a rubber mask like your brotherand was cheating all of us here.She is responsible for this.How did you catch him here?I suspected him. I wanted to catch him.So I enacted a drama to Asha and came out of her house.At that time...-Who?! -You go and...Take my cycle.This is what happened.Yes. I informed police as told by Shankar.They have arrested Asha and brought her here.Hey double criminal! Do not show your face. Turn the other side.God has created different faces because a similarface will create problems. Take my case.How will I survive if there is one more person like me?Why did you do this?You can say it with courage.I am an old criminal.I was in jail and escaped on night.Policemen chased me. I entered a house.Asha was there in that house.Asha...I requested her to save me.She said I resemble Sundaram.I enquired who that Sundaram was.She said he is Judge now but was once a lawyer.That she went to him to appear in court on herbehalf in a robbery case.But he refused to accept it citing the case was unjustified.She'll try to give him any amount of money but he did not agree.She even tried to entice him but he did not budge.He did not stop there.He spoke against her in court and sent her to jail.That day she took oath that she will take revenge on him.She said she got the right opportunityand will use me to take revenge.She said she will save me if I agreebut handover me to police if I refuse.I agreed because I can escape from policeand get a girl along with a luxurious life.I asked if Sundaram has a burnt face like me.She told me not to worry about it and she will handle it.So I made a rubber mask like Sundaram and wore it.And I wore gloves to hide my burnt hand.Then I learnt to talk, walk, dress up and behave like him.This is how I started to look exactly like Judge Sundaram.Then I went to hotel, nightclub etc with Asha.I went to resorts and enjoyed with her.Everyone believed that I was Judge Sundaram.How is this?Have you noted it down?Asha's sister Sobha was very good looking.She loved Raghavan.But I came to know from his letter that he did not love her.I tried to molest her.But she resisted.She threatened that she will disclose thatI am moving around with a mask if I misbehave with her.I thought it will be dangerous to let her live. I decided to kill herI told Asha. She agreed because she wanted to leada luxurious life and her sister was on the way.She told me to kill her outside the houseand put the blame on Judge Sundaram.We planned it.I wore the mask.I wrote letter to Sobha in the name of Raghavan askingher to come to a particular spot.I was waiting for her there.I removed my tie, tied her neck with it and killed her.But that innocent Raghavan was arrested.We came to know that Vijaya has come to argue his case.We set up a photo of Asha and Sobha with Judge Sundaram.We made Vijaya see it and she got the photo.Vijaya was enraged. Sundaram lost Judge's postBut in court, Sundaram had an upper hand than Vijaya.Asha came in disguise and told me about it.Immediately I planned and told her to call Banuto our house at 8 'o' clock.I did it so that Banu will see me who looked like JudgeSundaram and get confused.But she came at 6 'o' clock.I had removed my mask to eat at that time.She got scared of me and ran out.She saw original Judge Sundaram there.She thought it was me and fainted.He took her in his car to her house.I was looking all this from far.So I was hiding in her house before they came.Judge Sundaram made Banu lie in her bed and went away.It was a good opportunity.I went inside the room and locked it.Suddenly the maid came.I threw the flower pot to make her faint.But she died.I killed Banu also.Vijaya came and took photo.It was proved that Sundaram was the killer.Then Shankar came. I ran to protect my mask.He chased me.I lost patience and hit him on the head from back.That's all.Kannaiyan, the statement which you gave now...I have given this statement with sound mind and with full conscienceI pronounce that Kanniayan haskilled Sobha, Banu and Alamelu and award him death penalty.Asha was his accomplice to all the murders.So I pronounce her guilty and award her life punishment.I have to thank you. Without you we would not havecaught Neruppukannaiyan who was slandering my reputation.Thank you. Thanks a lot.On behalf of our friends, I request you not to worrybecause you were called a criminal by our sister-in-law.If Vijaya had not suspected,the real criminal would not have been caught.All is well that ends well. Bless you."}

In the sky, there are many shining stars, right?Those stars...The light we see now is said to be the light from ancient explosions.Did you know that?-is that so?- That's what they say.When I heard that, I thought it was so cool.It feels like being a rock star, right?A moment of shining brightly,And the brilliance continues to this day.Although I'm not a shining star,I can't become a superstar.I'm just a useless star.What are you saying?Why are you talking so gloomily?Aren't you the champion superstar?Hey, I think you're remembering for too long.I just have a good memory, that's all.So, what about this?Look at your hair, doesn't it look like a Chicken?Let's call you \"Chicken Star\" then.Chicken?But...For someone like me who is timid and cowardly...- Maybe it's suitable.- Right?Yeah.- Are you from the Chicken Planet?- That's right.Then shine brightly like crazy, my friend.It's terrifying, though.Oh no, wait a minute.Since that's the case...If...If I become a rich person in the future,I will...Give you...A ticket to board the space rocket.That way,You can watch the Earthsmoking in my hometown, the Chicken Planet.Go rock it!I understand.I'll really look forward to it.- It's a promise, okay?- Promise.It's getting a little cold at night.Yeah.How about eating a bowl of hot buckwheat noodles before going back?Oh, that's a good idea.I want to eat Tsukimi soba noodles.

Pass me the tools.This guy just said he wants to eat meat.How about letting him cut off his own ears with a knife?And then,let him use the knife to cut off his own earsand make him eat until he dies.Just like a plate of fresh meat combo.This guy has weird teeth. He should be able to bite hard on the meat.Great, let him cut off his own thing and make it a stamina set.Excellent, bring me the tools, Kubuji.Have you made up your mind?Should we do it?

It's like a perfect example.Oh my, so dirty.Let's go.He's disgustingly dirty.Surprisingly, it's not fun.Hey, it's over.By the way,I'll trouble you again.Clean him up properly.Understood.I should thank you for always leaving it to me.Turn on the air conditioning quickly.It still stinks.I'm hungry.Can I bother you for a moment?Long time no see.It's been a while.Have you been chatting with Murata?Murata?I'm sorry.- That...- What?I don't know who you're talking about.Are you looking down on me?Weren't you guys at Murata's place earlier?Are you talking about Jay?-What?- Are you talking about Jay?Jay?What?What's going on? Did that guy call himself Jay?Kawashita, he called himself Jay.It seems so.You guys were doing business with him, right?I can't contact him.We only bought weed from him.I see.We didn't do anything together.We're also...We haven't been able to contact him for about a week. We're worried.I see.I understand. If there's anything, I'll come again.Also,We have business. If you need anything, you can talk to him.Do you both live here together?Yes.What's the number?What?Huh?Your phone number.If you're doing drug dealing, be careful of the police, guys.Got it?If you want to make big money, contact me anytime.Don't hesitate.It's ice.But he named himself Ajei.We need to find someone else.J, huh? HIJ...Then the next person is K.Speaking of K,Isn't it Kawashita's \"K\"?Mr K.-Oh, so you're Mr K ?- No, I'm not.What should we do in the future?What else can we do?Like going back to Osaka or something.Why?I have this strange feeling.feel like Sota wants to go back to Osaka.I don't know what to say either.I'm already...34 years old.And I'm like this.Although there's nothing I can do in Osaka either,that's where I was born.Staying in Tokyo doesn't make sense anymore.My parents are getting old too.What about Rakuto?Then let me sell marijuana.What?-Are you serious?-Yeah.I don't have anything else to do anyway.It's no big deal. I don't think marijuana is a bad thing either.If you're abroad, you can also apply it in the medical field.- But...- But it's not like amphetamines are drugs.But didn't you say...Are you going to sell it?And especially in this situation.But I don't have any other options.Because you see...I'm like this.I can't find a legitimate job either.But I need money.This is the easiest way to earn it.You're not planning to ask the yakuza, are you?That doesn't sound like you at all.You're still saying such things at a time like this.It's scary to think about it. It was scary just a moment ago too.When they asked for your phone number, you hesitated, didn't you?I'm not scared.What nonsense are you talking about?I'm talking about you.Don't you think things are going south?That's the real yakuza we're talking about.- Pull yourself together.- Why are you suddenly getting angry?- You're stupid.- I'm not stupid.Don't simplify it like that.I'm asking you why you suddenly got angry.I don't have a home like grass does.The problem isn't there.Who do you think you are, acting like a big shot? So annoying.What?Someone like me can only live like this.You wouldn't understand.Live like this?Can I only live like this?You...What were you doing in the park earlier?What did you do?Did you hit a woman?Doing something so disgusting in secret.You don't understand me at all.That has nothing to do with you, right?Doing something so disgusting by secretly peeping on me. That's disgusting.You're the one always asking Mom for money.You're still a cowardly fake drug dealer at this age.And that pathetic tattoo. Could it be a match with your mom?Is that right?Are you a match with your mom?Hit me.Hit me!Come on, hit me!Come on, hit me!After that, I was busy preparing to move.Time passed quickly.Although I didn't completely reconcile with Rakuto,at least we were able to talk again.But it still felt awkward.My inconspicuous life as a fake drug dealer in Tokyo came to an end.On the Shinkansen back to Osaka, I could see Mount Fuji.On the opposite side of when I went to Tokyo.Although it was the same Mount Fuji,it felt like it was saying goodbye to me.That day, it didn't even show its face.And finally, I felt a sense of reality.I was really going back to Osaka.Without any destination in Tokyo.After eight years, the decision I made was...To buy a Shinkansen ticket back to Osaka.Sota, we're opening a shop.Come quickly.Coming.- Dad. - What?What should we do about the mayonnaise?- Use a generous amount.- got it.It's quite expensive.Come on, cut me some slack and make it cheaper.Here we go again.I can't handle you.Grass, the rice is ready.What are we having today?Looks delicious. I should have ordered the same.What is that?Is there a problem?Potato plus potato plus cherry.Because today is Christmas, right?Yeah, because it's Christmas.Even though it has nothing to do with Christmas.Then let's just say \"Happy Birthday\" instead.What are you talking about?That's how it is.- That's right.- Do you have any objections?Are you doing well?Yes, I'm being good.(Osaka-style okonomiyaki)It's so cold.Dad.It's time to eat.Okay, got it.It must have been born in the summer.It's already grown so big.Although I don't know who its dad is.- What about mom?- mom?Its mom should be around here.They don't have any parent-child relationship. They can have kittens with anyone.Not yet.They will multiply quickly.By the way, they live such carefree lives.Every day, they are free and easy.But even so,they are still a family.Right?Ouch, it hurts.Hurry up and eat, Mom will complain.I know.Alright, that's enough. Let's play later.Okay.It's Christmas,but there's no snow.The heavens don't know how to set the mood.Such a cold temperature in vain.That Christmas treewas bought the year you were born.Although we've kept it stored all this time.Even though it's an ordinary day.Wake up in the morning, say good morning to Mom and Dad.Make Osaka-style okonomiyaki.And say goodnight in the evening.I used to dislike this kind of home.But now, I think it's not bad.Having family members to say \"good morning\" and \"goodnight\" to is limited.Perhaps, for me,the little happiness I can find in Osaka-style okonomiyaki is just right.I thought I understood, but in reality, I don't understand anything.I'm back.Welcome home.You've worked hard.What's going on?Because it's Christmas, right?It looks so beautiful. Thank you.I asked the sun, it said it had never decorated a Christmas tree before.That's true.That's great.He must have fallen asleep.The sun really wanted that star on top.He said he wanted to give it to Mom when she comes back.He's trying so hard to stay awake.Here you go.I will work hard.(Naha City First Makishi Public Market)Moonfeels tired.Stars will be responsible for lighting up.If the starsfeels tired,The moon will be responsible for lighting up.if the mooncries,the stars will smile for it.If the starsCries,the moon will smile for it.- I'll go talk to him.- Big brother, I'm sorry.- Yeah, get your suit ready.- Okay.What a hassle.And then, the two of them got into a fight at the nightclub.Your little brother messed him up like that.I understand. How about we talk separately about this matter?After all, it was done by someone in our family.We also have a responsibility for not disciplining him properly.Alright, let's explain it clearly.Hey, we're going to talk about some gang-related stuff now.You go outside.Okay, I'll go out.- You go out too. I'll handle it for you.- Alright.I'm really sorry.Our brat caused you so much trouble.And you had to make a special trip for thisIt's alright, it's not me who got hurt. It's not me who's in pain.Even though he's a troublemaker who deceives people.He should still have money.Make him compensate you with 5 million. Is that enough for you?That's more than enough.By the way, is it really appropriate to give us so much?Why not? It's not my money anyway.How about this? I'll give that kid 1 million for his recovery.We'll split the remaining 4 million.How can that be? After all, we're the ones who messed up.- We have no reason to take that much.- Let's just go with it.After all, it was you who opened up this opportunity.Let's split the money peacefully.A win-win, right?A win-win?(Highest education level: Graduated from Anryou Middle School in Naha City)(Personal requirements column) (I will work hard for my family)You don't seem suitable for our family.Sorry, we've already found someone.Hmm, your tattoos are a bit...No work experience? That won't do.Not bad, not bad.Look at this packaging. It's cute, right?Young people nowadays like this kind of thing.- Big brother, you're wise.- I'll take care of it.- We have various evasion methods.- Please come this way.Really, all the Japanese police are idiots.Are you doing well?You're sweating a lot. You're so nervous.Please have a seat first.So, why are you here?Well...For some reason,I'm looking for a regular job.But I can't find one with my appearance.So I was thinking if there's any job I can do here.Of course, there is. You're a delinquent, after all.But don't worry, we don't care about that here.But I don't want to be in the underworld.Listen, being in the yakuza isn't something you can just decide to do.So don't worry about it.It's just a simple part-time job.What about the partner you were with?Is he doing well?He went back to his hometown in Osaka.I'm not sure about his current situation. He hasn't been in touch since he went back.Who was that again? Murata? No, what was his name?- Jay? -Yes.I don't know what happened to him.Although I'm not qualified to say, he's a very carefree person.That's true.But he's a lovely person.I'm really worried he might cause trouble everywhere he goes.Could he have gone back to his hometown?Don't come closer.Don't come closer, you're dirty.First things first,Today, the company he runs is short on staff.I was thinking if there's a suitable job for you.Do you know about synthetic cannabinoids?A dangerous drug?It's not that bad, really.It's 100% legal.But everyone has a negative impression of it, so no one dares to take it on.I'm looking for someone like you,someone with integrity.You've sold marijuana before, so you must have integrity, right?But I've never been a drug dealer.Come on, don't lie.Forget it, it doesn't matter.It's a simple job.we will sell onlineor have delinquent youths sell it between seniors and juniors.You'll just be responsible for delivery.It's simple, right?I'll pay you a high hourly wage.But I have concerns about this kind of thing...What's wrong with you?Didn't you come here looking for a job?You must be in need of money too, right?A man has to know how to make money, you know?Don't you have a Girlfriend too?You won't look good if you're broke.She'll be completely disappointed in you, you know?Am I right? Are you a man?It's not a bad thing. Let's make a big profit.Once you have enough money, you can quit.Good. This is a congratulatory gift for starting work.Just a token of appreciation.I'm not sure about this matter. If you have work-related questions, ask Habu.Good luck.Hey, why don't you go and pour a glass of juice for them too?- Okay, I got it.- Sorry, I'll do it.It's okay, just sit there.Sorry about that.Nice to meet you.I'm Kawamoto.Put it away quickly. I'll help you with that.Here, in our place,Tattoos, earrings, beards, dyed hair, none of it is a problem.Everyone is like that.I have a beard too, it's not a problem.Here's your drink.I'm really sorry.Go ahead and drink.You won't get caught, I guarantee it. Don't worry, it's legal.It tastes really good.Please try it. Top-grade beef.Impressive, have some more sun.Sure.Rakuto, ordinary ones are fine.The delicious meat tastes better, right?That's true.It's great that you found a job.Yeah.Can I eat this?Wait a moment for this one.You can eat this now.No, I want this one.He wants meat more than sausages.Rakuto, why don't you give it a try?Don't look so puzzled.You should know your product well.This is work, you know.Right?- No, thanks.- Don't you want to?No, take a few more puffs.Right?One more...One more...Feeling nauseous?Do you feel sick?Do you feel sick?Are you about to throw up?No, you can't vomit here.Wait, let's go to the restroom.Can't be, let's go.Are you okay?Not good?Not good, huh?Not feeling too well.Still want to throw up?It's really bad.Please come in.It's spacious, isn't it?- Very spacious, right?- Yes.Why don't you sit down and take a look?It's okay, the president said we can use it as a staff dormitory.Don't worry, madam.Rakuto is a talented person.Thank you.Although it's a bit old,I hope you don't mind.Feel strange?Don't you like it this way?Did we force you?No, it's not like that.Because this house is too luxurious.It's not like that, don't worry.Madam,I wish you a happy new life.That's it then.- Rakuto, can you come here for a moment?- Sure.Your efforts don't matter at all.I want you to show me results.I'm really sorry.It's about time.Understood.I'm really sorry.I'm really sorry.I'm really sorry.Rakuto.- Can I trust you?- Yes.-Really?-Yes.Our opportunities are limited.Even if we keep working non-stop,we can't make big money, right?In the end, we're just being manipulated by the yakuza.Do you think this should continue?It shouldn't.Right?Listen carefully,You're not allowed to escape.I'll give you your share for today.I'll take care of these things.With this situation, we'll soon have 10 million.-After it's safe, I'll give you half.-But...I want to work during the day.- What can we do?-But it's always at night...I understand what you mean.But, I still have to take care of my kid.I understand that, but Rakuto.A man is in his element at night,that's when we make the final move.Right?- Let's make a big profit.- But...Cheers.I'll pour it myself.Did you hear that?She said she'll pour it herself.Caught you.I'm really sorry.Sorry about that.- Sota. - What's up?Sota, your phone is ringing.Got it.Isn't that Rakuto? Long time no see.Sorry, you must be busy, right?It's okay.How have you been?I'm doing well.I'm doing okay, I guess.I'm working hard too, although it's just as a security guard.You work as a security guard?But it puts my mind at ease.I'll call you again.How's Kusachan doing?I'm doing well. Now I'm a takoyaki shop uncle.Oh, I see.A takoyaki shop uncle, huh.That suits you well.I'm working diligently, you know.By the way,I'm really looking forward to it.Looking forward to what?Your birthday is coming up, right?I didn't give you a gift last year.You don't have to do that.Instead of that, don't push yourself too hard.As long as you're doing well, that's enough.Yeah, it's great to chat with you.But I'll definitely give you a gift.I see.Thank you.I'll call you again too.When I have free time, I'll come and see you.Yeah, you're always welcome in Osaka.\"Just treat this place as your hometown.\" I'm serious.Enjoy unlimited servings of delicious Okonomiyaki.Thank you.See you next time.- Alright then.- That's how it is.Who is it? You seem so happy.It's my \"Chicken Star.\"What?Alright, let's get back to work.Did he say it's a chicken?But that's not a \"see you next time.\"It's not a real \"see you next time.\"(Thanks to Guke's 10th anniversary) (Mikemai Ramen now priced at 520 yen)(Transform your room into a starry sky) (Indoor planetarium)(Second generation code and association)Alright.I'm sorry, understood.I understand.My apologies.This is awful.I can see the bones. Climb out of the well and take a look. This is too interesting.It's a call from headquarters.They're demanding our presence at the regular meeting the day after tomorrow.What a hassle. It's not like it's a training session. They just want money, don't they?They always take money from us, the meager third branch.We're just operating as a franchise, that's all.-Right?- Yes.You go to him.No, that won't work. It's not appropriate.Let's forget about it for now. Come and take a look at this.This is a drug called \"Crocodile.\" Look at how it transforms after using it.I heard it's popular in countries like Russia.It's really intense.Those spineless Japanese brats would never dare touch it.They're all cowards. This dangerous drug suits them well.They mix it with all sorts of unknown toxic substances.Those idiots buy it happily, getting their brains fried and malfunctioning.And why call it a dangerous drug?Such a tacky name. It only makes those foolish brats want to try it more.It's like something a candy store would sell.This way, even elementary school kids can get their hands on it.But we should thank the higher-ups. Thanks to them, we can make money.- Look, the popsicles have changed like this.- I'm sorry.Alright, got it.Rakuto.Who is this for?This is for my closest friend.Closest friend?How should I put it? A trusted confidant.Sun, you should write something too.Write \"Happy Birthday\"Should we use the method of the black caterpillar again?The caterpillar family is so disgusting. We need to eradicate them completely.Can we use this crocodile?The whole family's hands and feet rot away.But their faces look like this.Mooimai, why don't you write something too?- That's right.- That's right.What color do you want to use?What color would be good?How about green?I want aquamarine.Then let's go with aquamarine.- Phone call.- Hmm.Aren't you going to answer?It's for you.Even though it's Sunday, the president called.Hung up.We don't need to add anything here.Wouldn't it be better to answer it?Maybe it's something urgent.Maybe.Yes.Rakuto?Yes.Are you free now?I am.- Sorry for calling on a Sunday.- It's okay.There's something I want to talk to you about.I happen to be in front of your house. Shall we have a cup of tea together?Okay.Is that okay?I understand.You really said let's have tea.You constantly poking me is dangerous.- Tea is not a solution, you idiot.- Let's not talk about it anymore.It's really funny. Rakuto must be scared to death.open your mouth.What are you doing?Start crying already.Stop it,don't do this.Stop getting in the way.If he knows that kid's father is me,I wonder what expression he would have. I'm so looking forward to it.By the way, with this, Rakuto will be completely in our hands.We can do whatever we want next.That guy seems quite useful.But that woman is really foolish.Even though she's a heroin addict, she offered me a million to stop.It doesn't make any sense. She took a bunch of heroin from me.This will be the last time.I'm sorry.That woman is really stupid.It's like a plot from a manga.Even though I don't care about her anymore,when she suddenly said she didn't want heroin,I found it strange and saw her with Rakuto.- i forgot my phone- what?- Never mind- what?When I saw them together, I thought, \"Jackpot.\"Wasn't that shortly after he came for the interview?He's really a foolish moth to a flame.Hello?No problem, you're welcome anytime.Pleased to meet youVery well...And then I saw him desperately selling gastrointestinal medicine.It's all rigged.(Digestive and intestinal medicine)Your efforts are irrelevant.I'm asking you to show results.Should we sell a little bit of drugs?Like X, ecstasy pills.- Hey.- Yes.Can you really harm your own child?What are you talking about? Of course, I can do it.That's not my child, it's Rakuto's child.So, it's the worm's kid.I just shot a few rounds in her vagina, and he was born.I'm an all-knowing, all-powerful god.That's it.This is a photocopy of the manuscript I found in his room.And then? Any clues?There are hidden texts that imply criminal acts.Like \"Sacred Punishment\" and \"Day of Judgment,\" and so on.\"Holy Water\" seems to refer to sulfuric acid being sprinkled everywhere,but it also contains urine as an ingredient.There seems to be no grudge between the murdered gangsters.It's probably a random killing spree.Rakuto?Yes.Are you available now?I am.(Kill the despicable humans)What are you doing?Hey, come over here.Where are you?Where are you? Momobei(God's retribution)Please spare me.Please, spare me.Say something quickly.You despicable human.Your name is Saotome, right?- (God's retribution...)- I have already investigated.What is it called \"Saotome\"?You're just a bald old man.You wretched creature.Are you trying to fool me?I am a god.I will report this at the regular meeting.Hey, release me, will you?Can you do that? Just release my hands, or even my feet.Either the hands or the feet, it doesn't matter. Please, just release me, will you?Really, just release me. What are you doing?Go find all the thugs lurking under Hatta.Don't underestimate the yakuza. SeriouslyThe rest is up to you.You've worked hard.Great, you're safe now.- Great.- You can go home now.Um, can you please release me?Hey, don't speed.One, two, three.That's right, let's continue like this.Let's skip the cola cake, sashimi is good.- Run, run!- What's wrong?Run!- What's wrong?- Don't ask, just run!Hurry up and pack up, okay? It'll be fine.- Happy birthday. - You don't have to do that.Why is it beef? Usually, we have cake, right?You're already a middle-aged man when you're 35.Be careful with diabetes.You're an important heir for us.Have some steak to boost your energy.Get married to a good wife as soon as possible.I know, you're so naggy.Don't worry.This guy's hairstyle...He not only got married but also lives happily.- Really?- So happy!It feels interesting.Sota go blow his hair.Are you stupid?This is not a toy.It looks delicious, look.By the way...Is my package here today?Huh? No, it's not.Oh, I see.Eat up, the meat is cooked.It's good to be back.Tida is always happy.Rakuto.Who brought so much water here?It must be God.Who's God? What does he do?It's hard to explain.Do you feel warm here when you think of your mom?Yes.Then that's God.You didn't explain it clearly.Everyone has a heart, no matter who they are.Heart?It's a place that can become warm.Look there, Tida.The sun.The name Tida means the sun.- It's also God, right?- It would be nice if it is.Hey, Tida.-sun. -god.Tida.Rakuto.Are you okay?You look a bit exhausted.There have been a lot of tiring things lately, it's a bit overwhelming.Are you feeling unwell?I'll go rest, it's okay.It's fine.(Two years later, Okinawa)The chicken that can't fly...It flew up.Sota.He's here.Thank you for coming all this way.My name is Sota.Goodbye.Thank you.Originally, we planned to give you a birthday presenton Sota's birthday together.but…a serious incident happened.We escaped back to Okinawa like this.So we couldn't bring the gift for you.I bought the exact same thing.today…I brought it with me.Can you please accept it?Give this to your big brother.It's the Planetarium.Planetarium?Also...There's something else to give you.Although he might get angry,I think it's best to give it to Mr. Sota.Even though he stopped drawing halfway.(Chicken star)I'm really sorry.I'm sorrySota,I couldn't explain it properly to you.Although I have a lot to say,I'm just a fool.I'm really sorry.I...I've never been able to forgive my mother.I felt like she never protected me.After my mother remarried, my stepfather...He really is...A scumbag.I was beaten every day.I'm sorry.Day after day...Every minute, every second, I was so scared.I always felt...The world was so small.Like being in a prison.But you know,I met Tsukimi in Okinawa.We both hated our biological families.It was like running away from home, free and happy.I've always liked her.In Tokyo,By chance, I ran into Tsukimi again.Tsukimi?Although at that time, Sota misunderstood.The girl who got beaten up in the park by me.Are you kidding?You're a mother, right?Tsukimi has also been through a lot.I tried my best too.Cheer up.Although I couldn't speak to Sota,I didn't want to keep it from you.I always felt like we were a family.I also felt like I was a father.Thinking, \"So this is what a family is like.I was really happy.I know my time is running out.So I didn't get married.It's Hodgkin's lymphoma.It has spread to my spleen.I always feel...I finally became a father with great difficulty,and now I have to say goodbye.Isn't it annoying?So I chose to run away.I'm really useless.Although i didn't tell you.I've always cherished this ring.I, um... I really liked Tsukimi...But I couldn't even manage to kiss her once.Can you believe it?It was really short-lived.Chicken star can't shine.It's a useless star.Although I have this nature,But it's great to meet Sota.It's embarrassing to say this,What are you doing? You fool.But I've always felt that you're like my big brother.Being able to meet Sota and Tsukimi,when I was lost in a dark world,when I was happy,when things were going terribly,no matter when,I felt like you were my home.Goodbye.What a loser.How should I put it,My heart feels like, \"I'm back.\"I, um...I should have started my journey earlier.but,You should take it slow, really slow.Take your time.Laugh sometimes,cry sometimes,live your life to the fullest,taste delicious food,appreciate beautiful scenery,be a good son to your parents.I envy being able to do all those things.so,please live on behalf of me too.Survive.And one day...Let's meet again.It's a promise.I'll wait for you on the chicken Star.Feels...Like a farewell letter.If it's the moon,Feeling weary,The stars will take care of lighting up.If it's the stars,Feeling weary,The moon will take care of lighting up.If it's the moon,Crying,The stars will smile for it.If it's the stars,Crying,The moon will smile for it.Sun,From today, you're a dad.Help Mom put on the ring.- congratulations. - congratulations.Holding a wedding for someone who's no longer in this world,And I'm unexpectedly the matchmaker.I never thought something like this would happen in my life,But somehow, it feels...Like a wonderful thing.Sun, let's go.Here they are.Mint?Wait, what are you doing? That's mine!If you don't like it, give it back to me.Your companion,Which star does he live on?Is that the one?I'm still looking.I see.I don't know who told me this,But before a person is born,A divine-like being will come to tell youThat you have such a fate and when you'll die,And they'll ask you, \"Despite that, do you still want to meet that person?\"Those who answer \"yes\"Will be born into this world,And after being born,Those memories will disappear.Could it be the same for your partner?Just to come and see you?Then next time, I'll have to go and meet himAlthough not now.Thinking this way,Does the chicken Star really exist?it exists.It truly exists.Do you think it all ends here?No, it doesn't.The rocket has been launched.Is it true? Wow, we can see the whole Earth from here.Tsukimi and Tida asked me.To fulfill the promise with Rakuto and go to the moon.Rakuto only gave me a rocket ticket.And now, Tida has become the world's top soccer player,Replacing his father as a superstar,And he gave me a ticket for a space trip,Telling me to use it to find the chicken Star on the moon.It's really chaotic.Me, an uncle who makes Osaka-style okonomiyaki, ended up going to space.Oh, life is full of unknowns.

What a terrible god is love.He bruises, tortures and abandons us.That was your fate. It isn't everyone's.Oh hear me,divine justices.Don't let Jason, the author of thesetroubles, escape your vengeance.I have been patient long enough.I tell you again, leaveCorinth immediately.I have a wedding to attend.Go now voluntarily or mysoldiers will force you out.No.I'll go. I'll leave.Enough, enough. Just go.It's easier for us allif you leave quietly.Give me a day, so I canmake arrangements for leaving.No, plan how my sons will survivenow their father has abandoned them.You have children, so pity mine.I know you don't care whathappens to me, but save them.Give me one day.I'm capable of some pity,Medea. I'm no monster.Take a day, make arrangements for travel.But rest assured if tomorrowmorning finds you or your childrenstill within my borders,you all shall die.This is my ruling.It won't be reversed.I weep for the blowsthat rain down upon you.What protection will you find?Medea, we're lost.- Oh you fool,I might be choked with misery,famished by grief,but there's still life in me,I'm not finished.There is trouble comingto the House of Kreon.Do you honestly believe I would kneeland weep in front of a man like that,except to get my own way.I wouldn't have touched him, ifI didn't think we could be saved.He thinks he's in charge.He will live to regret the momenthe allowed me to stay here,a single second more.One day is not long.But in that time, I will bringdestruction down on Kreon,on Jason, and onhis pale new wife.They'll feel the quiet touch ofdeath before I leave Corinth.I only need to decide how.Shall I set fire to the palace?Watch them burn as they take their vows.Or better still,visit them while they lie asleepin their false wedding bed,stinking of sweat and sin,and turn their white sheets red?Too dangerous,if I were discovered, it would bemy life, not theirs, which would end.There's only one way.The way women have alwaystaken our revenge, poison.Watch their bodies beingeaten from the inside,see the liquid firesear through their veins,and feel my revenge roaring.But doing this now is reckless.Nowhere else would acceptme if I have murdered in Corinth.I must wait, pray that some pillarof defense rises up in my name.Then, when support isassured, I'll fulfill my destiny.And if help doesn't come,then the hour before I'mdue to leave this place,I'll go their palace with my swordand I will send them all to judgment.By you Hecate,the queen that dwells within me,I swear that not one of them shallwound my heart and go unpunished.I will see their marriage endmore bitter even than mine.I will do this.Up then Medea,onto the danger,I need courage now more than ever.As like a final pregnancy, Ifeel fate start to grow within me.I am of the Sun God's raceand I have courageenough to see this through.More than that,I'm a womanand we have seenenough, each of us,to call ourselves experts in terror,experts in pain.Oh my innocent boys,this darkness wasn't meant for your ears.I wish it had not been for mine.Go! Go, run play.Do not go near your mother.I see the clouds filling the sky,a storm approaches.Soon the rain will beginto fall and we'll be drowned.Now the tide of thealmighty sea runs backwards.Day and night are interchangedand the order of the universe is reversed.Men, once thought of as honest,are revealed as treacherous.Women, forever slanderedby the tongue of gossip,feel a change come over our livesas the sun of honor andof truth shines only upon us.The dead poets shall nolonger sing of our unfaithfulness.Phoebus, god of music,give us the gift of song that we may singto the open sky of the wretchedness of men.Jason's disloyalty to Medeaproves they can't be trusted.Desire blinded her andnow desire leads him away.It has often been saidthat sex is the root of eviland it has proved so here.Promises no longercarry any weight or grace.Men have stripped that from them.Now we alone carrytruth upon our backsand it's a weightwe can easily bear.So take your revenge, Medea.The gods support you.Though you have no friendsand no home, we'll help you if we can.Justice must be recognized.Medea!Medea!I've told you beforemore than oncethat your temper wouldget you into trouble.You could have stayed here.You could have been happy again.Now you've forcedyourself into exile.Your words don't hurt me.I've forgiven allthe terrible curses,the vengeful lies you've spat at me;I petitioned Kreon to let you stay.But you are your own worst enemy.You've insulted the royalfamily one too many times.You scared the kingand the result is banishment.Still, I don't hate you.I'll support you and our sons in exile.You won't be destitute. Trust me.Trust you, Jason.Oh, you're a foul andcraven mess of a man.You come here my enemy--the gods'enemy--and you ask me to trust you?Have you fallen so far into lust you'velost a sense of your own shame?I'm glad you're here.It makes me stronger inmy loathing just to see you.Just to show you what you've made of me.Look at me.I saved your fetid useless life.I loved you like nowoman has loved before.I abandoned my father.I slaughtered my brother.Have you forgotten?I gave you sons.I bled them out for you andyou have thrown me away.You have turnedeverything upside-down.Do promises mean nothing to you?Do you think that the gods have died,that you could so easily breakthe oaths you made in their names?You see this damnedhand which once you held?You see this body you usedto embrace, polluted now,having been touched by you,infected and infested with your seed?Just for old times' sake, let'spretend I don't despise you.You've said you'd help me.Then tell me, Jason,where shall I go?Where shall your bastardsons and I settle ourselves?Back to Colchis, our so-called home?Where I dyed the sand withinnocent blood to give you pleasure?Well, think what awelcome we'd receive there.You'll support us?Where?There's nowhere for us to go!Nowhere!To think of us as you sitdown at your wedding meal.Your family reduced byyou to wretches, to beggars,reduced to nothing, tothink of us and choke.I hoped not to have to trade wordswith you like this.It seems I must defendmyself against these charges,steer my course safely throughthe storms your tongue whips up.Your sacrifices?I've given you morethan you ever gave me.I married you,I made you happy, I civilized you.You'd never known law or justice.You were nothing when I found you.Now you talk with kings and cry to gods.I don't go to Kreusaout of lust or greed.Or because I hate ourold life, I go to survive.We are strangers here,we have no friends.We would have starved.I will not see my sons, my family,gasping and shivering in poverty.Whilst I have breath I will see themlive the best lives I can give them.Now I'll be a prince and cankeep you and your sons safe.Keep my family safe.Is that wrong?You're jealous of Kreusa.Blind with envy, or you would beable to see the wisdom in what I do.Do you really expect thesesighs, these words, to win me now?You're the most callous,the most sick-hearted of men.Or you'd have told me of your scheme.Asked for my consent forthis most generous of acts.Protecting your sons?Giving them a better life,when, like a thiefcreeping through the night,spurred on by pathetic, midlife lust,you hid your plans and you deserted us.And if I discussed it withyou, you'd have agreed?- Look at you!- We both know why- How could I have told you?- ...you left.You looked to the futureand you saw yourself old,with an old foreign wife,bringing shame on you.- Think what you like,I'm marrying Kreusato ensure our safety,yours, mine, and the boys,to make our familysteady with royal blood.In the name of heaven,woman, stop this stubbornness.Open your eyesand see the help that I am offering you.- Spare us all, Jason, from your help.Your help offered nothingbut destruction and exile.That was your own fault.Don't blame me for that.My fault? Was I the onewho betrayed our family?You cursed the king, you threatenedhis daughter and his palace.What did you expect?My curse falls not only on Kreon,but on all who have wronged me.Be warned, Jason.This argument is over.If you will take money tosupport the children or yourselfin exile, I give it willingly.If you need help,I'll petition friends of mineto take you in. Medea, let me help.- It's madness to refuse.- I will have nothing,nothing to do with your friends,your help, nothing to do with you.The help of a monstercan do me no good.The gods have seenthat here, I offered myself,my contacts and myresources to your aid.The troubles will onlyincrease by ignoring me.Leave us alone.Oh, you stay too longaway from your young bride.She's waiting, Jason.Go wed her now.For, God willing, you'll havea marriage like no other.Medea, to see you like this is to seethe love and madness go always together.The extremities of passionlead us only into terrible danger.I pray I live my life freefrom love's burning temper,that my soul never knows jealousyor the wild desire that led to this.Medea, to see you like thisis to see the horror of exile.To be torn again from your homeand thrown to the mercy of fortune.The future for younow is dark uncertainty.I pray I never know thehelpless anguish of an outcast.Forced to walk the earth.Forever living out of bags and boxes.May those who have brought you so low.Who show so little pity.- May they perish. - May they burn.May they know the painthat now we see in you.Hey, Medea!No friend was ever greeted fairer.- Welcome. Aegeus,King of Athens.Oh! My friend.What are you doing herein this unlovely place?Ah, I was visiting the Oracle,a wandering fool seeking wisdom.What did you want to knowthat brought you so far?I asked the truest of truth tellerswhy my wife and I remain childless,unblessed with offspring.Still no children?Still no children.We continue alone.I'm sorry to hear that.What did the Oracle reply?Ah, he spoke words too subtle for man to understand.How will you unlock the prophecy?I'm going to ask for guidance fromPittheus, an expert in these matters.But I thought that before I left,I'd visit my old friendand her young family.Oh!Mm, for the boys.- Yes.- Yes.- Yeah.- Yes.I wish you luck.I hope you find your answersbut you cannot visit my family.My family's broken for ever.What's happened?My husband,he has abused me.He's abandoned me.What do you mean? Where is he?He's taken another wife.He's left me.Left our sons,left us destitute.I can't believe it, another wife.He's marrying her today.Now he's in love,grossly in lovewith the little girl,Kreon's daughter.If Jason has betrayedyou, then he is a villain.O, Medea, I don'tknow what to say.- There are no words. - I'm so sorry.Your marriage,always seemed socomplete a partnership.To see it broken, smashed topieces before me, it hurts my heart.Aegeus, I am undone, bereft,and at Kreon's command, mysons and I are banished from the city.As of tomorrow, we're exiles.Does Jason allow this cruelty? Hestands by and watches you cast out?He does nothing, nothing to help us.I implore you in the nameof friendship, pity me?I do. I do.- How can I help you? - Don't let us be cast into the elements.Receive us in yourcity, in your palace.Help us.You'd seek sanctuary in Athens.Help us and I will seeyou blessed with children.I can do it.Where the Oracle fails,I will succeed.I have the magic of my ancestors.My drugs are potent,you know it's true.I'll give you children.Help me and help yourself.If you would do this,then for your sake and your sonsand yes, I admit it, also for myself,I'll give you shelter,come to my palace.You will live in safetyfor as long as you wish.No man shall harm you.- My friend.- But, I can't take you with me from here.I can't risk offending Kreon.Make the journey yourselfand you'll be welcome.- I'll do it.- And I will do all I can to protect you.Do swear!- Don't you trust me? - I trust you,but Jason and Kreonare strong enemiesan oath will mean that you cannot giveme up when they come to drag me off.I live weak in the shadow of their power.- What shall I swear by?- Swear...by the earth, by the life giving,life crushing dry, brown dirt.Swear by the Sun Godswho birthed my race.Swear by my ancestorsand by your own.Swear by all the gods at once.Swear never to expelme from your land,never, while you have breath, to allowanyone to rip me from your protection.I swear, by the earth,by the Sun God,and by the whole host of heaven.Then it's done.And if you break this oath nowwhat curse do youinvoke upon yourself?Whatever falls uponthe worst blasphemer,let it fall on me.Go, then, in peace.When I have finished here andhave done what must be done,I'll join you in your city.And make your family grow.Goodbye, my friend.Goodbye, Medea.I'll welcome you in Athens!The moment of greatest distress,when all hopes seemed tohave died, this king appearslike a welcoming harborto my shipwrecked life,the gods are on my side.O, my friends,we have started on ourroad towards victory.This sad man gives me hopethat my foes shallwither before mein a terrible andshrieking vengeance.I see now what I must do.There are things that cannot be avoided.The wheels are turning andwe cannot step off this road.Go to the wedding andask Jason to come to me.When he arrives I'll use soft wordstelling him what he longs to hear.\"Blessing his marriage,\"his command is sacred.In the name of womanhood, go.I'll give him a gift forhis young blushing bride,a cloak, exotic, strange,warm yet delicate,beautiful and drenched in death.So addled with my poisonthat the moment she puts it on,her skin will burn,shrinking, bubbling like fire.And she and all who touchher would die in terrible agony.This is revenge,but it's only a beginning.There's something moving in the shadows.Growingto give Jason the bitter tasteI carry with me since he left.Everything he does he does for them.They're the sunthat lights his world,so I will plungehim into darkness.Those that I bore himin the agonies of love,those that I gave to him so will Itake back from him, take back for ever.Unspeakable,unthinkable crimeagainst the godsand yet,to do it here,and then escape in safety to Aegeus.This would truly be revenge.No one will say of me that I sat weakand dispassionate like wives before me.I choose to take back my life.- My life!- Can we speak?- It cannot be stopped.- Could you honestly do it?Lift the knife to your children's throats?I could.I will,because in ending their lives,I end Jason's happiness.Never again would heknow peace or sleep.And when he closed their eyes,he would see only their blood.The knife that cuts theirthroat would sit for ever,resting gently against his heart.- But in doing it you destroy yourself.- It doesn't matter.Can't you see,he left me.- I'm already nothing.- Medea, please, listen.Think of Aegeus, King of Athens.Think of his sacred city?How will he receive you?How can he receive you? If you dowhat you propose to your own children?Ugh, my stomach turns to think of it,of their trusting bodiesyielding beneath you,to think of their bloodstaining your hands, your mind.We implore you, donot kill your babies.They will beg formercy from their mother.How will you refuse? You cannot.You asked for meand I come to you.Even in the middle ofmy wedding celebrations.Despite the hate-filledwords you fling at me,I'm here.When we last spoke, husband.My words burnt with anger.I was drowning in loss.I'm sorry.I beg your pardon for my sharpness,my intensity of feeling.See it as a sign of thelove we want shared.I thought about what you saidabout your reasons for leaving,to protect our sons and me,to bless us with a royal connection.I can see the wisdom in all of this.It was wrong of me to curse you,to allow my womanly jealousyto blind me to your wisdom.I blame myself,my pride, my sex.I ask forgiveness.Bring them out, to showthe regrown love and friendship,I hold towards you and your bride.You can see our sons.They can see their father.Daddy!Stand now next to yourfather. Jason, take his hand.They look so like you.It pains me to thinkof the hidden futurethat lies ahead for us three.Hidden, yet surely hard.Yet, when I see youreyes, Jason, in their eyes,I know they will growup safe and strong.Boys, release your father'shands and go and play.You know now that yourparents are good friends.How can we see this and stayquiet, knowing what is to come?This is the greatest of terrors.- The very ground beneath us is diseased.- It boils.Oh, my wife.For this gift,thank you.I do not blame youfor what has passed.Your anger was understandable,but your wisdomand your goodnessin allowing me herein letting me see my beloved boys,in letting me help you,this was grace.My boys,you are my proudestachievements.And I see you tall,stand over your enemies.I'll see you returned to your fatherwhen I am king of this place,to sit in gloryand you, Medea, with us.- Why are you crying? - I was thinking of them.Be comforted.I'll see to it that all is well with them.I trust you.See these tears simply as asign of a woman's weakness.Tell me what upsets you.I brought them into this worldand when I think of the cruelty of life,of fate, I cannot help but weep for them.Enough of this foolishness.There was another reason I asked you here.Firstly to apologize formy rash, hateful wordsand to unite you with your sons.Second,to ask you to take our side.Speak to Kreon for us.No, for though I know I must be banished,these boys have cursed no one.They are innocent,let them stay.Beg the king to reconsiderhis verdict of exileand allow them to remain here inthis city with their father, with you.You'll let them stay?I know they'll be safe with you.I don't know if I can persuade him.Well at least ask Kreusa, your wife,to ask her fatherto show them leniency,to let them stay.He won't refuse her.Not today.I'm sure she'll do it.Let me help you to persuade her.I have a wedding gift for you,so precious, so rare,that if our sons present it to hershe's surely to petitionher father on their behalf.A cloak of delicately tissued silk,given my people by theSun God--an immortal gift.This girl who you have taken as yourown will feel so blessed by this, not oncebut by a thousand times over.She has noblestman to share her loveand now she has thenoblest gift to seal the match.You boys, you'll takethis gift to the royal bride,your father's princess love.But, Medea, this gift, you should keep it.Don't you think a royal palacehas enough gold and silk of its own?Keep it, you need things of worth.Kreusa values meabove all gifts, all wealth,she's rich enough, keep this yourself.Even the gods are swayedby gifts of such beauty.Now fortune smiles on Kreusa,she is brimful of blessings.Her triumph of love, ofyouth, of beauty is complete.I would give up mylife, let alone this trifle,to secure the safety of our own sons.You boys,when you arrive at the wedding,you stand up talland you beg the princessin your sweetest voicesto take up your caurseand to help you to stayand as you beg,you hand her this.Make sure she takes itin her own royal hand.May you succeed in thisand return with the newsyour mother longs for.You girl, go with thembring them safely back.Farewell.And all our hopes are gone,our hopes that these boys might be spared.They are doomed,as surely as the princess, tempted bythis cloak, will wrap herself up in death.We see in your eyes, thepoison that sits on this gift,the darkness it brings.And sure enoughas your sons deliver death,so the clouds grow fat and yourservant's vision of rain approaches,the heavens rumble.We pity her, poor wretch,daughter of a king andbound to the worst possible fate,and her new husband,who little thinks of the destruction hebrings on the one he says he now loves,and worse, worseon his dear sons,and we pity you,hapless, helpless mother,who'll kill her children, themost precious part of herself,because she and theyhave been abandoned.O gods, let your fury fall,let the skies blackenlike burning flesh,drive out remaining light.Night will swallow all.Jason sends meback with your boysand news to lift your spirits:they were received by his bride.She took their gift in her own white handsand they are freed from exile.- Ah! - Why do you sigh?You look faint, but thisis your hour of success.- Don't you see that this is good news?- Help me, I shall fall…Isn't this what you wanted to hear?I thought this news would please you.The news is what it is.- Don't cry, the tide turns for you.- Yes, the tide turns.It rolls out as the gods and I intended,yet it makes me sick.I see why you're upset.Your boys will stay herewhilst you must leave,but comfort yourself,at least they will be safe.You've given your news,go back to the wedding.Jason will needyou soon I'm sure.Thank you for bringingthem safely back.Before you speak,go inside and preparea bath for my sons.Please.Do not speak to me.Oh, my boys,is this how it will beyou remaining herewith a city, a father,a home, while I amcast into the sea.Will I not see you grow?I thought I'd be with youwhen you became men,found wives.I thought I woulddeck your bridal bedswith the rarest flowersof our homelands,reminders of your ancestors.Seems it was for nothing Iwent through the agonies of labor.I screamed as my body tore intwo to bring you forth. I thought,at least in the weakness of old age, Iwould have you there to comfort me.It seems I'll be deniedand all my sufferingswill have been in vain.I'm going to lose you.And I will drag myself throughthe rest of life in a terrible sadness.Why do you look at me?And why do you smile?Oh, no, do not, do not raise thesehands to wipe away these tears,nothing can remove them.Oh, when I see your eyesI forget everythingI've said, my plans.No.No, I'll not go through with it.I cannot hurt you to hurt yourfather, for in doing so I'll maim myself.I'll take you with me.Oh, my boys,we'll find fresh soil.When I look at you, my boy,I always remember my brother.Who Jason had meslice into tiny pieces.Can he go free?This man who hastorn my soul in two?This fear, this woman'sweakness, I must fight it.I see your eyes onme, you girls of Corinth.You heard the softnessflow from my lips.No more; look on me, and see agodly strength in this earthly body.Look on me and see vengeance.Get away from me,go into the house, find yournurse, clean yourselves up.If you cannot look on this act,this sacrifice, yousilent accusers, then go.Run back to your gentle livesand your loving homes.This place is not for youor stay and see. Ah! Do not!My heart,do not do this thing.My heart has torn in two.Do not do this thing.My babies, they'll protect me in old age.Let them live.Let them live.Let them live!And hand them to my enemies,to be damned, to be butchered,to be cursed withtheir mother's name?This cannot be.By you devils, that dwelldeep within the earth,by the cursed name ofHecate, my mighty ancestors,they must die and it is fittingthat their mother holds the knife.There is no escape.The circle turns.And as I speak and grieve, in thepalace of Kreon, a terrible vengeance,my vengeance, grips Kreusa.And even now, the robe on hershoulder and her skin begins to burnand as I think of her,my confidence grows.I am through the crisis.My sons! I can say goodbye.My babe.Let your mother kiss you.Let me hold yourtender head next to mine.You must know, my sons,that you are so dear to methat I will send yousafely to another place.Your father has robbed youof your home and your family,but I will direct you to safety.Now go inside, Icannot look at you.My sorrow defeats me.Inside!At last the way is clear.I understand what has beenand what I must do. See, see!The gods fulfill the prophet's words!The sky is black, so be it.Fly, Medea!You must gather your thingsand leave this place!You have donean appalling thing.Don't hesitate here, go!- What's happened that requires my flight?- The princess is dead.Her skin withered up, and Kreon too.Thank to your poison.The news is good. I'm glad.Are you insane?Can you smile at thedevastation of our royal house?At this evil, this horror?- Are you not afraid?- Just tell me what happened.The manner of their deaths.If they have suffered it willbring me greater pleasure.When your sons,hence at the palace, theywere received with joy,welcomed like doves of peace.Everyone thoughtthat their arrival provedthat you and Jason hadsettled your arguments.At first Kreusa didn't want to seethem, but Jason persuaded her,instructed her as his wife to embrace them.And when she saw the giftthey brought her, she smiledand agreed to lift the sentence uponthem. They were banished no more.She took the robe from its packing,wrapped it around her andadmired her breathless image.She moved through thewedding, receiving admiring looksfrom all who saw her, but thenoh horror.She suddenly turned white.Her eyes rolledin on themselves.She began to foamat her colorless mouth.Someone raised a cry,an inhuman shriek of panic,and Jason and Kreon came running,racing to observe her desperate end,they watched,frozen,as the robe devoured,consumed, ravaged her flesh.Till there was nothing but chalkybone and matted, charred hair.Her remains lay still,all life extinguished.Kreon dropped to his kneesand took the brokenbody in his arms,held her to his androcked and wailed,lamenting that he at hisage should lose a daughter.He tried to stand,but the robe that had devouredKreusa was now attached to him.He struggled,tearing his flesh as the courtlooked on in stricken horror,he ripped himself away and collapsed,devoid of breath,devoid of life.The corpse of the king and his daughter'sremains lie piled on the marble floora heaped mountain of death.I cannot tell you of the face of Jason,the anguish,the despair that overtook him.Words cannot capture thecolor of his grieving eyes.Quickly, if you wantto escape, go now.I can't be found here.Run, Medea,for the sake of your sons,run!Oh, my friends,witnesses to what must come.Know that I am resolute,the time has come to actto perform my final deed in Corinthand then leave for Athens.I must take my children's livesor leave them to someone else,some crueler hand be their butcher.I'm their mother.I brought them forth in painand I must take themfrom this world in peace.They are clean, they areinnocent, they are prepared.Steel yourself, my heart.Ah! Still I hesitate.Oh you patheticweak willed woman.A devastated lifestretches before me.I must embrace this emptiness.Now, Medea,without a thought to whoyou are, who they are,throw off your sex.There is only this time,this place, this moment now!Oh, god of thesun show yourself,shine down upon thislost woman and intervene.Change her awful fate,only once before have we heardof a mother destroying her babies.Ino, mother of two sonsbutchered by her hand,the gods made her mad and shefrothed and flamed around her boys.She killed herself,cast herself over a cliffinto the great black sea.What horrors will follow--can follow--here?Oh, God, stay her hand,destroy the demons that possessher soul and save their lives.Did she birth these babes,tend them,nurture them only to dragthem down to an unnatural end?Their blood dripped on thisground will pollute the earth,infect the air.This will become a place of death.Oh, gods,act now and spare us all.Tell me now where she is!Is she still here or has she fled?She'd better hide.Either throw herself down intothe earth or soar above the cloudsif she wishes to avoid vengeance,avoid justice! Medea!Medea!Did she think she coulddo this and escape?After destroying the royalfamily, the rulers of the city?My new wife,her father the King!Did she think she could do this and escape?But I'm not thinking clearly.None of this matters now.Her punishment willcome when it comes,I'm here for my boys,my sons,to take them from her.Where are my sons?Where are my sons?Where are my sons?Jason, you don't knowhow unhappy you are.You are too late.Why?What can make this worse?Does she want to kill me too?Your sons are dead.She has killed, killed them both.What have you said?Pull those words back.Out of the air betweenus. They hang there!Pull them back!What? What did you say?Be sure of this, they are gone.How?Where?They've gone.She's taken them.Where is she?Medea!Ah, my heart will break.Medea!You are foolish togo searching, Jason.Were you looking for them or for me?Say what you like.We're beyond you now.You see me transformed.My ancestors have revealed themselvesto me, prompted by my courage,and delivered me to greatness.What… have… you… done?What have you done?You shall be hated,cursed by the gods,by all mankind,by me for ever.How are you still living,still breathing, after this wickedness?How does the same sun thatshone on my boys still shine on you?Now I seethe curse that followedyou has turned itself on me.I'm punished now for saving you,punished for loving you.Now you,who killed your brother andbetrayed your father,wedding me to sate yourdisgusting lust in my bed,who bore me sons, my sons.You are trying to kill me with grief,you are trying to break my heart.Look at you,nothing I say can touch you now.Oh, die, Medea.Go from herewither and rotback into the cursedground you came from.The gods knowhow much I loved you,how you betrayed me,how with surgical precisionyou cut me out of my own lifeand they know and you knownow how I have repaid you.They were your sons!And I grieve for them.But to touch your heart,to make you finally feelsomething of my pain,it soothes me.Oh, my boys, whata mother I gave you.Know, my sons, it was yourfather that slaughtered you today.I didn't kill them!- The gods know who is to blame. - They know you.They know evil.Oh, Jason, there's nosuch thing as good and evil.We are both aswretched as each other.We'll fly to Aegeus,to safety.Far, far from this home.Far from this blood-stained land.I'll carry you boys to safety.They are dead.Dead! Dead!Drowned in blood.Drowned in their parents' sin.Give them to me. Let me bury them.They are beyond you now.Go back to your rotting wife,there's nothing more here.Nothing more.Now,now…Up!Up, Medea!We'll fly to Aegeusto peace.To peace with my sons.Oh, come to me, my children.I see my ancestors.Lifting me now.Carry me!Purging me!Come,gods!Now!We are not subjectto our own wills,our own desires,but to the fates and thefortunes that the gods hand to us.The future is turned before oureyes into wrenching heartache,into ashes and to splinters.From today, I knowthat truly hope is dead.I ask you again,you who watch,how can there ever be any ending but this?First, silence.Then darkness."}

Get me the report on yesterdaysrobbery please.What am I supposed to do with her?Khanna, she claims to have informationabout Mia Wallace...so she's a potential eye witness.Eye Witness?Bedi sir, she's blind!How can she be an eye witness?You do half your work with youreyes closed...but somehow you figure things out...So, go and figure this out too!Get some work out of him too,Get some work out of him too,He's just sittingthere and getting fat.and you just loving jerking mearound, right?It's the best part of my day.Go take her statement and sendher home, or am I asking for too much?Fine, I'll do it?Listen!Yeah?Go!What are you laughing at?Oh my God...Good morning!MorningName?Gia Singh.Gia SinghI'm Prithvi Khanna, I'm the DIWould you like some water?No thank you, sir.I read your report last nightNow you're claiming to haveinformation about Mia Wallace?Yes, sir!But, how do you knowit was Mia Wallace?How are you evensure that it's a person?Like I said before in my statementI heard a sound from the boot...The driver dismissed it sayingthere are some things in the bootThe second time,I heard a knocking soundHe turned on the music and startedto drive fast...Immediately after theaccident he got out of the car.As I was getting off the cab,I felt him put something in the boot.The weight felt like that of a personWhen I asked about it, hetried to force me back into the car.Okay...Thank you for coming in.If something comesup we'll call you. Okay?That's it? You already hadthis information.It's because I'm blind.No, not at all.If I could see, what would you ask me?The usual questions...Car number, driver description...He was 5'10\" or 5'11\"...Average build...Maybe around 35 to 40 years old.-Is that all?-You're 5'6\" or 5'7\"Also average buildAround 45 years oldHow do you know this?It's not that difficult...I can tell the height by theangle of the voiceBuild by its reverberationAnd age through intuition.There are also certain things thatone can't seeLike the fact that youhad Chinese food for breakfast.How do you know that?Soya SauceIt's normally used in Chinese food.This is so good.Can you also tell my future?No but seriously... seriously...This is.. This is wonderful.Let's talk some more.So you're convinced there wassomeone in the bootYes, sir.But why Mia Wallace?Because I heard on the news...that Mia Wallace got into a taxi fromclub Alcatraz at around 10pm.The taxi picked me up fromthe Orphanage around 10:45pmThe distance between club Alcatraz andthe Orphanage is around 30 minutes.It's highly unlikelythat two kidnappings happenedin the same area on the same nightThat's why I believeit was Mia Wallace.Let's assume that you're right andMia Wallace was in the boot...Let's assume that you're right andMia Wallace was in the boot...Why did he offer you a lift?Why would he risk getting caught?He saw a Blind girl, alone,waiting for a taxiFor him, it was a double winWhat threat can a Blind girl pose?That's why he wasn't worried aboutleaving you behindExactly!He figured you wouldn't be ableto identify him anyway...When I sat in the car he gaveme a bottle of water.When I started asking questions,he tried to force me to drinkit and that lead to the accidentForcing you to drink water?Why?Maybe he was trying to drug meRight...What else?Old Spice!He was wearing old spiceAnd...When I tackled him outside the carI felt a watch on his right handSo he's probably left handed.People usually wear theirwatch on the weaker handAgreed!Anything else?He was Indian!So basically, we are looking at aleft-handed, Indian, taxi driver...who wears Old Spice...And has a potentially damaged car.Yes!We could check some garages too.Just give me 2 minutes.I'll be right back!Bedi Sir!I have a strong hunch about this sirBut this is just a theory,we can't act based on a theory.The blind girl isn't in a position tomake a positive ID of the victimWe don't even knowif there is a victimNo description, no car number, nothingFor all we know...a suitcase could have fallenout of the boot.Sir, he was forcingher to drink water...Why would he do that?-There has to be a reason.-Khanna!My wife forces meto drink water every dayMy wife forces meto drink water every dayshall we go arrest her as well?Sir, she's your wife...She has to force you!Look, you want me to back this right?Please.Find the kidnapper,with substantial evidenceI'll get you a promotion along withan arrest warrant. Deal?Are you serious?I suggest you start the paperwork.Thank youShow me, mate.Kobe for what? For why?Fake Kobe!Go get that!You know if you want to shine,You need to bring the skills yourselfGo on!Go on!Hurry up and come back man,I'm not finished beating you yet!What the...?How did you make that?I'll be back in 2 minutesOla (Hello).Any of you guys work around theEastvale PICarlos trabaja por ahiNow give me a subtitle.English please.Carlos usually works around there.Carlos!

We're going to have fun...?- I'll talk to you later.- I'll see you later.- Later.- Thanks, Esposito.Consuelo?Consuelo?Yes, Mikey?Do you have anybrothers or sisters?- Yes.- Really?How many?Four brothers...and five sisters.Wow.Why did your parentshave so many children?I mean,if they were poor,wouldn't it be betterto just have one or two?It was God's will.But do you reallybelieve in God?Heaven, hell,and angels and allthat kind of stuff?No.So...how was school today?- The same.- The same.The same as what?Just the same.We're studying the Holocaustin Social Studies.Oh, yeah?We did the same thinglast year also.How is the class?I'm supposed to watch\"Schindler's List\" for homework.The movie's, like,almost four hours.Then I'm supposed to writea report on survivors.You knowany survivors, Dad?Hmm.Do I know any?Personally?T echnically,your Zeda is a survivor.He wasin a concentration camp?No, but he hadto escape the Nazis.But I thought he came overto America before the war.He did, with his family.But his cousins,they had to stayand they were all killed.If he'd stayed,he would've been killed.So in my book,he's a survivor.Even though it was onlyhis cousins that were killed?That could've happenedto him, or to me,if I'd been alive.Or you.Or me?You mean,then we're all survivors?Well, yes.If it hadn't beenfor Hitler,he wouldn't have hadto leave Europe.We would've been European.But then, in a sense,since you would'venever met Dadif your familyhad stayed in Europe,if it weren't for Hitlernone of us would've been born.Get the hell out of here.Man-!It's just, like,conversation.T ell me...you make a living at this?Well, sir,I'm actually not doing thisfor the money.When you make a documentary,you do it for many reasons.But money is certainlynot one of them.I don't get it.Well, sir...a lot has happenedto the landscapeof the suburban high schoolsince I was a student.I feel it wouldbe a valuable,perhaps evenenlightening endeavor,to chronicle the changes.To get intimatewith the realitieskids and parents facein American schools today.Yeah, well, whatever.I'll let you knowif there's interest.Excuse me,where's the bathroom?You a pervert?Toby: No.Actually,I'm a documentary filmmaker.Oh.You mean like\"Blair Witch Project\"?Well, no. Um...I'm doing oneon high school students, in fact.What for?Well, it's kind of...it's kind ofa sociological studyon the aftermathof Columbine.Is this, like,to get into Sundance?Yeah, it's possiblethey would be interested in it.Doubt it.Actually, there is some interestfrom the Sundance Channel.Whoopee.HBO and MTV have alsoshown some interest.So you have connections?Toby:We're trying to do a filmon suburban lifestyles.Kind of an \"American Family\"for the new millennium.I thought this was aboutkids getting into college.- Oh, it is.- Marty: Which is it?You got to keep your focus straight.Yeah,you're absolutely right.The focus is on the collegeadmissions process today.And you want Scoobyto be the focus of all this?Scooby anda few other studentsof differentsocioeconomic backgrounds.You didn't mentionany other students before.I don't have any yet, but-Either Scooby is the focusor forget it.Yeah,I thought I was the focus.I want to be the focus.- Ah-!- Toby,we need this to bea positive experience.I supposeI could reconceive.Reconceive.Scooby does havea quality...that I've beenlooking for.A quality that is emblematicof America today.It's part disillusionment,part hope.Twinkies!Fern:Boys, take napkins.Napkins.Not to be crass,but what do we getout of this?Don't worry,he doesn't mean money.I know.I know that.Well...sharing your story,your ups and downsand so forth,can, I hope,be an illuminating experience.Yeah.How do we knowwe won't be exploited?No, it's true.Mr. Livingston,I fully understandand I share your concerns.You feel vulnerable.I know this isa very difficult questionbut what itcomes down to is...can you makethe leap offaith in me,the same way that I have to makethe leap offaith in you?This is a great school,I don't carewhat anybody says.It's not perfect,but the peopleare really cool-like the teachersand kids-they really careand all.I know they make funof New Jersey all the time,but I don't care,'cause they're just snobs.'Cause Jersey iswhere America's at!Toby:Walking down these hallways-hallways just likethe onesI once walked downas a teenager,I couldn't helpthinking back to a timewhen every dayI woke up depressed,suicidal,consumed by despair.Had things changed?Was the competitionto get into the mostprestigious schoolsstill a requisiterite of passage?Beneath these masksof courtesy and friendliness,I knew that there weredarker forces at work.And I knew that Scoobywas the keyto revealing the truth.Scooby, Scooby, Scooby.What are you thinking?College, SAT s,your parents,your brothers,your friends...How is it you dealwith all this stress?The pressure to get intothe college of your choiceis incredible.They did a study recentlyof the youth in Bosniaduring the bombing.They foundthat the stressthe young peopleexperience therewas less than what Americanhigh school students go throughwhen applying to college.Toby:Is that right?- Yeah.- My God.So what do you think?Well...I'm not really surewhat you're trying to say.It's funny, I suppose.But it seems gliband facile to make funof how idioticthese people are.I'm not making fun.I'm showing itas it really is.You're showing how superioryou are to your subject.But I like my subject.I like these people.- No, you don't.- Yes, I do!I love them.- The camerawork's nice.- Thanks.I'll tell Mike.Well...it's stilljust the beginning.I know I can...dig deeper.Fern:But, Marj-May I call you Marj?What it reallyboils down to is,what does it mean to be a Jew?Exactly. Tzedakah- charity.And the new wingat Beth Israel is-Actually, last yearyou gave $500.But this year, $1,000 wouldnot only be a mitzvah,it would bring youto a new level-Yes, of course.Your gift would alsogive you a Chagall menorahand two ticketsto the dinner dance this spring.Because it's true.Israel needs us now.Fern: If not now, when?That's wonderful.I'll speak to you next week.You too. Take care.Hi, Scooby.Scooby...

A cool car?- Yeah. Duh.Scooby:That's pretty cool, Stanley.Thanks.How did you get it?It's my dad's.He hides it under someold TV Guides in his closet.Gee.Your dad's smart.I know.Is it loaded?No...

I'm sorry.I'm just-a little nervous.I don't know why.You should be.Here.You can keep it.Scooby?Yeah?You know...- I like you.- Yeah.- I know.- I mean...I know.Everyone knows.Oh.Um...Do you think...Do you think that...you'd let me...Okay.If you feel like it.Just give me a second.- You want some?- No, thanks.Recording plays:? I was surprised?? I was happy for a day?? In 1975?? I was puzzled by a dream?? It stayed with me all day...?? In 1995?? My brother had confessed?? He was gay,it took the heat off me for a while?? He stood upwith a sailor friend?? Made it knownupon my sister's?? Wedding day.?I'm sorry! I should have nevermade you take the SAT s.Oh God!I'm burning to death!- I'll never do it again!- Conan: Hey, Scooby.How's it going?Conan O'Brien?Whoa.What are you doing here?I'm looking fora last-minute guest for my show.Any suggestions?- I'll be your guest.- Really?Well, all right.Let's take a look at the television,and see how we look.Cool.Welcome to the show, Scooby.Nice to have you here.- Great to be here.- Thank you for dressing up for us.This is very classy.T ell us, what kind ofprofessional plans do you have?What's in your future?Well...I was thinkingI might work for you.T ell me, what do youwant to do for me?- What's your idea?- Be your sidekick.And maybe, eventually,become a TV talk show host.TV talk show host?Okay.You were at sidekickeight seconds ago,then TV talk show host.You'll be a Latin dictatorin about a minute.Let's see what they thinkof the first idea.I'm curious whatthe audience thinks.What do you think,should Scooby be my new sidekick?Wow.Scooby, new sidekick,everybody.Oh, man.Yeah?- Hey.- Hey.What's up?There's somethingI need to talk about with you.What?There's some rumors...Like what?You know...Stanley.What?Like, don't take thisthe wrong way.I mean, I'm cool.But...you know...I've got a good reputationat school.Well...I reallydon't want it ruined.No problem.I'm cool.Thanks, Scoob.Esposito, what the fuckdo you think you're doing?You're tackling like a bitchon my football team, son.You better bend your ass overand hit somebody, understand me?- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.- Understand me?Then do it!Livingston!That's the wayto hit that hole, son.We're going to becomea football team today.Let's move the ball!Move, move, move!- Break!- I want to see you hit those holes.Defense, fillthose goddamn gaps!Let's go, guys.Let's do it.Set left, set left.Red, 17...Red, 17...Hut-!Hut! Hut!Mikey:When I'm in high school,I'm not going to playany football.I'm just going to concentrateon class rank.What did you doin high school?I did not goto high school.Weren't there high schoolsin El Salvador?We had to work.My family was poor.It must have beenhard being poor.I am still poor.Hmmm.But, Consuelo,even though you're poor,don't you haveany hobbies or interestsor anything?No, Mikey.But, like...what do you like to dowhen you're not working?I am always working.But when you're not,like now,what do you like to do?This is work.But it's not like...real work.This is just babysitting.You know, your job'sreally not so bad,if you think about it.You should smile more.Toby: When the sky is clearand the sun is warm,you're reminded of howbeautiful things can be.A lamppost...a sign...a straw wrapper,blowing in the wind.But whenthat dark cloud appears,you realize how fragilethe balance of life is.When Brady firstarrived to the hospital,He was unresponsiveto verbal stimuli.We performed a CT scanwhich demonstrated a largesubdural hematomawith mass effect.Since the removalof the subdural,he's been in a coma.When I first met the Livingstonsit was in the first 24 hoursof Brady coming in afterhis tragic football accident,and they were actingin a fairly typical way.We're not the ones that need help.My son needs help.My son's in there.He can't even feed himself.I don't even knowif he's going to bea vegetable or not,for Christ's sake!Toby:But what about Scooby?How would thisaffect him?What meaningis to be found in this?This is definitely better.You think so?You don't thinkthat this might notbe a little dry?This is not an entertainmentyou're making.This story abouta kid in the suburbs,and the state ofthe college admission process,has, with this Brady crisis,evolved into somethingmuch richer and more provocative.Yes, I know. Still, it should besomewhat entertaining.Without this footage, withoutthis rigorous documentation,it would feellike exploitation.No, no, no.No exploitation, this is serious.But don't you find ita little funny, too,at the same time?You've got a family tragedyon your hands.Will you tell me what's funnyabout that? About a kid in a coma?- Nothing, I guess.- Why are you making thisif you can't treat your subjectwith appropriate gravity?Okay, you're right.You're right.We need to screenwhat we've got.Invite someregular people,just some randomoff-the-street types,and see what real peoplethink of this.I don't know, Toby.We really have a long way to go.You still need to geta lot more footage.It's probablya little premature-Then we can inviteserious intellectual types.- We're not ready.- Hip alternative types...- who understand the process.- Toby, we're not ready!I need to see thiswith an audience.What's an audiencegonna tell you?I don't know.Maybe they'll like it.Consuelo!I spilled some grape juiceon the floor.Consuelo?Consuelo?Consuelo...are you crying?No.Yes, you are.I can tell.What's the matter?Mi Jesus.Speak English.?Mi Jesus est? muerto!Consuelo,I'm sorry, but you knowif you don't speak EnglishI can't understand you.My Jesus.Who is Jesus?My baby.You have a baby?My grandchild baby.Gee.I didn't even knowyou had any children.But why are youso upset about Jesus?He is dead.Oh.How did that happen?He was executed.He was on death row...and then he was executed.How did they execute him?Poison gas.Maybe it's for the best.I mean, if he was guiltyof doing something wrong.People who are badshould be killed.Don't you think so?Jesus was not bad.Maybe he was and youjust didn't know it.He wasn't.But still,you can't be sure.I am sure.But really,you never know.I know!Why was heon death row?For rape and murder.Consuelo,what is rape, exactly?It is when you...love someone...and they don'tlove you,and you do somethingabout it.Sometimes I feel likemy parents don't love me.Well, then,when you get older,you can dosomething about it.Consuelo?I spilled somegrape juice upstairs.Do you think you couldclean up the floor now?? We're gonna have fun?? We are gonna havefun, fun, fun?? In the sun,sun, sun...?Dad?Do you think that Bradywill ever get better?One in a millionrecover.Maybe he's that onein a million.Mikey, there's optimism,and then there's stupidity.It's a very fine line.I don't thinkthere's any hope either.I was just tryingto make you feel better.- Thanks.- You're welcome.Dad?Would you let me tryhypnotizing you now?Yeah, sure.Go ahead.Hypnotize me.Okay. Stay there.I'll be right back.Mikey:Just a sec!Be right there.Could youturn around to me?Just turn.Thanks.All right.You must lookat this shiny object...and concentrate.Relax your legs.Relax your arms.Relax your shoulders.Now keep your eyeson the shiny object.Your eyelidsare getting heavy.Heavier.You're getting sleepy.Sleepier.Now let your eyesclose shut...and you aresound asleep.Now...you are completelyunder my power.I am the only voiceyou can hear,the only voiceyou will listen to.Now...when you wake up,you will bein a good mood.You won't worryso much about Brady.And I will be your favoritefrom now on.If Brady dies,you can be sadfor a little bit,but I will still bethe most importantperson in your life.You will neverbe mean to me,and always give mewhatever I want.Also, you shouldfire Consuelo.She's lazy.Now, when I snapmy fingers,you will remember nothing,but you will doeverything I have asked.One...two...three.Hey, Mikey,want to getsome ice cream?Okay!It's like, yeah...I caved in.I mean, I had to.My parents,they're like...still really depressedabout Brady.So I wrotethe bullshit essay,filled out the applications,did the interviews...I figureI can always drop out.Toby:Where did you get in?Princeton.What did you geton your SATs?200 verbal,710 math.Kinda weird, I know,but I think they thoughtit was, like...good weird.We used pull.You have to.Sometimes you just have to, Toby.Toby: What kind of pulldid you have?I have a cousin.Very big giver to the alumni fund.It's all aboutwho you know.Look, we're not suckers.Everyone else is out theredoing the same thing.He's right.- Damn, Toby.- It's too hard.- This thing won't open again.- Don't. Let me try it.It's- yes,the button is just stuck.- Hey, Toby?- Hey, man.I was wondering...is the documentaryalmost finished?Yeah, we'regetting there.Can I see whatyou have so far?Sure...yeah, as soonas I havea screening,I'll let you know.- Thanks, man.- Okay, man.Okay.Gin, I win.Let's play again.- Marty: Hey, Mikey!- Hey, Dad.Come hereand give me a hug.- Gee, you're home early.- Yeah.Listen, why don'tyou go upstairsand keep your mom and Bradycompany for a bit?I need to speak alonewith Consuelo for a moment.- Sure, Dad.- Take off.Ahem-Consuelo...Mrs. Livingston and Ihave discussed this,and we've cometo the conclusionthat we are not very happywith your work lately.So we're goingto let you go.I don't understand.We've been happywith you in the past,but now we think,maybe it's time for a change.I know you've hadtrouble at home.Maybe some of thatis reflecting on your work.Consuelo: But, Mr. Livingston-I work very hard for you...and your family.Marty:I understand.I'm sorry it hadto end this way.Florsheim,can I help you?Hi, I'm tryingto reach Toby Oxman.Sorry,he's off today.Okay.Um... thanks.? I'm coming overin the wrong direction?? I only want to bethe center of your attention?? For long enough to show youI'm worth the trouble?? That you take?? I want to see the waythat you portray?? A boy who's gonna tryto change his life today...?Hey, Mike.Is Toby here?No, he's not.Oh.Do you have any ideawhere he might be?I think he's ata test screening.? I want to see the waythat you portray?? A boy who maybedoesn't have too much to say?? And you can drawyour own conclusions?? But you'll findI'm not a fake?? You can turn awayfrom me?? But there's nothing that'llkeep me here, you know?? And you'll never bethe city guy?? Any more than I'll be hostingThe Scooby Show.?Marty: I think Scooby'slike a lot of kids.He just hit a speedbump.Now he's going to find his way,his path's going to be clear,and I think he's going to continuehis education at a good college.And everybody elseis going to be happy.Toby:Mr. Livingston,aren't you a bit fearful that Scoobywill be confronted withhollow valuesand systemic conformism?I don't know why this isso hard for you to comprehend.I had a terrific timein college.I've got a terrific job,a comfortable salary,terrific wife,three terrific kids,and every year I giveto the alumni fund.Now, why are you trying to makecollege out to be a bad thing?A negative experience?You had a bad time?Well, too bad!Get over it!Stop trying to imposeyour misery on othersby going around saying,\"Life is bad.Life is horrible. \"Life is tough on you?Well, boo-hoo!Scooby:Well, yeah.My dad is kindof a goofball.You just have to...pretend to go alongwith his ideas,'cause he reallydoesn't get it.Like, I could bethe next Oprah...for all he knows,but he's never evenseen the show.Toby:What is most important to you?I don't know.I'd like to be goodat something.It doesn't have to be TV.I mean...it could be movies...anything.I'd be willing to direct.I'd like to be...you know...famous.Not necessarily a superstar.Just famous.Be recognized.Get fan mail-things.Toby: Scooby, now I understandhow you wantto be like a TVtalk show host and all,like Conan O'Brien,but did you know thateven he went to college?- He did?- Yeah.He went to Harvard.Oh.Newscaster:... one police officer,eight others were wounded...Mom? Dad?Can I sleep with you?- I'm scared.- Sure, buddy.- Come on.- Come in bed with us.Come on.Snug as a bugin a rug,Yeah,there you go, pally.Marty:You're monster-proofed.Scooby...Oh my God,Scooby.I'm so sorry.I'm so, so sorry.Don't be.The movie's a hit.? Picture a scene in your mind?? Look at all the peopleand take note?? Of the setting behind?? Listen, watch and wait?? A plot beginsto take shape?? There's a story,and then?? Characterswill come to you?? Relating eventsas they choose to?? But all their wordsand actions?? Come entirely from you?? If you're a storyteller,you might think?? You're without-?? Responsibility, and youcan lead your characters?? Anywhere you want?? You have immunity?? Have you consideredthe way?? People might reactto all the things?? That your characters say??? And are their actionshand in hand?? With what you wantedto portray??? Are you sick?Are you crippled, insane??? Expressing the desiresthat daren't speak their name?? Are you the oneto be blamed??? Now you're a storyteller,you might think?? You're without-?? Responsibility, but in directions,actions and words?? Cause and effect?? You need consistency?? How can you finish the tale??? Lives which have played a part?? Are summarizedfrom the very start?? And episodes left out?? To make it allgo your way?? It's a mighty big world?? Some of it I've seen?? But mostly I've only heard?? And stories are all fictionfrom their moment of birth?? You're just a storyteller,you're not trying to escape?? Responsibility, if we believeyou then you're successful?? But you don't makeclaims of verity?? You're just a storyteller,you're not trying to escape?? Responsibility, if we believeyou then you're successful??

Find another screenwriterif you can't wait.The Telugu, Hindi and Malayalamproducers are waiting for me.They'll come rushingat my call! - Gosh!No, sir. Instead of rackingyour brains like this,I suggest you watch10 English filmsand write a mixed story from it.Off late, there is no paperor pen at story discussion.It takes placewith video cassettes and TV.Very good idea!Can we remake Doctor Zhivagoand present it as Doctor Kunchako?- Doctor Kunchako?It may work for a Malayalam movie.But we're doing a Tamil movie.Don't torture me.They don't permit meto write lust stories.The people here don't appreciatepolitical stories. I'm stuckwith a stingy producerlike you who refusesto shoot grand historic movies.What else can I write about?It's very simple,Melur Murugesan sir.Let's take the camera toa village untouched by technology.We can film an old mangrinding areca nuts,a group of 5-6 womenmaking cow dung cakes,a husband applying turmericon his wife's back near a well,a group of young boys cladin loincloth riding on buffaloessinging a philosophical folk song.Please write a storyabout a guy in pantsfalling in love with a girl withlipstick in the given background.It'll be a huge successas per the trend now.I need 20 days' timeto write the story in my style.I'll keep it shortand sweet.

I caught it!Did your legs getcaught in the chair?Nah! I meant I got a story!I'll write an epic love storylike 'Ambikapathy and Amaravathi.'I can't believe it. - We got tocash the audience emotions.The producers earn morewith the public's tears. - I see.Will you killthe lovers in the end?Don't mock mythought process. -Sir!What if things got serious and Istart crying instead of the public?See it on the silver screen!- Why are you late, you fool?You must be more activeat your age in fetching drinks.I wonder what you'll do in future.- He'll brew liquor.Why did you send himto buy drinks? - Why not?He is free in the morning.Yes, Murugesan brother.You write stories only at night.I remain free through the day. So...I wish to join some schooland pursue studies.- Go ahead. I'll help you!Find a school and let me knowhow much you need forthe fees, books, uniformand other expenses.I'll ask him to payat once. - Sir!Why should I pay for yourassistant's education?Not only that! You will have to takecare of our food until we leave.I shouldn't have cometo Kodaikanal from Kodambakkam.What are you grumbling?Nothing, sir.

Gauri!Excuse me,is this boy very popularamong the students?- Yes, madam.Poor boy, he studies in schoolall day and during the night,he works at someone's houseas a help so he can pay the fee.I see.The Princpal who is hereto preside the function,our Chief guest who is here to gracethe occasion with her presence,the kind-hearted lady,Dr Kalaivani madam,everyone present here and mydear friends, I greet you all.In this poetry meet,when I saw this crowd,I hesitated in the beginning.The title of my poem is,'A poor man's dream'!I gathered words, and to write itdown, I looked for a paper.The pen I hold in my handkisses the paper,but it also reminds me of something.I ask the penwhy did it stop writing.Why did it kill my emotions?Why did it wake me from my dream?My pen stumbles immediately.And tells me, the ink refusedto flow out and hence it stopped.The reason being my poverty.But poetry still comes to my mind.That is the beauty of poverty.I have struggled many a times,because I had no ink or no pen.It's a shame if I say thatas I feel bad for the paper.Thousands of song lyricsare hidden in my heart,but I have no notebookwhere I can pen them down.A printed note called currencyis the reason for my miseries.God, please show me a way out.Put an end to the darkness in my lifeand light a lamp of enlightenment.I prayed to God.I don't know if Goddess Saraswati,Kalaivani heard my prayers or no,but my guarding angel with a heartof gold, Ms Kalaivaniled me to light.Clothes to wear, food to eat,shelter above my head,a way to study... When I was cravingfor these, she showed me light.May that mother live for long.Better than doing a hundrednoble deeds isthe deed of helping a studentwho wants to study.It is because such mothershelp children like me,that we are ableto complete our education.It is her kind heartthat the students in this schoolare provided with free books,every year.In short, she is a womanwith a golden heart.I am indebted to herand I thank her for doing her part.I extend her a warm welcome,and end my welcome speech.Mom, do you knowwhat happened today?What is it, dear?You look very happy today.What happened?- Today, Hari spokein school with such intelligence.My God! I never imagined hewas so good. Wasn't that brilliant?The thought that I made such anintelligent boy do household choresis pricking me. He wishesto study and progress in life.I wish to help him. - This isthe right age to shape him.As soon as I saw this boy,I had this gut feelingthat he'll definitely bevery successful in future.- You're correct, mom.It is true that you recognisedthe real talent in him.I somehow missed to notice it.Good night.Where is he? Hari...Hari...You need not do the householdchores anymore.The Headmaster of your schoolwas all praises for you.He expects you to top the class,in the final exams.So, I want you to concentrate moreon your studies. - I will, madam.I'll also work.- No, I'll arrange aroom for you. Stay there and study.Thank you so much, madam.- I forgot to ask who pays your fee.I have no one.One of my friends who brought mehere from our village,enrolled me in schooland paid my initial fees.And then, he left me hereand went back to our village.Oh, no. That's bad.Okay. If you need any money,take it from our Estate manager,Mr Mali. - Madam...What is it? - If you couldplease assign me some work...What is that for? I got it.Do you find it embarrassingthat I'm paying your fee? Okay.Why don't you help our Estatemanager and assist him in accounts?Thank you so much, madam.- Good night. - Good night.Do ou know something?- Tell me what did madam say.I have got freedom from Manmadan.Wow! Is it?What are you whisperingin her ears? Go and cut vegetables.Else, I will throw you out of here.- That's not possible.You cannot order him around anymore.Madam has told himto assist the Estate manager.- You come with me.Fair skinned guy, wait and see.Some day when you are asleep,I'll apply charcoal on your face.Then I'll seehow she continues to love you.Gross income from salaryminus source deduction.Rs 1275.- Hmm.Income from plantation...- Hmm?Plantation...Minus wages paid at site...Paid at site... why is thereno revert? - Hmm...Bank interest...Bank interest paid...Rs 17000.I'm telling you about bank interestwhile your interest is elsewhere.No, sir. I have a small doubt.What? - Instead of describingin detail, what if we writethe same thing in short?Everyone will understand at least.That's the secret of our job.If we write in a mannerthat anyone understands,why would people like me be hired?Just write down what I say.She switched loyaltyas soon as she saw him.Sir, what about your desires?- Vembu...Sir?- Who did I make Idliin the morning for?For Gauri. - Who did I makethe roast in the noon for?For Gauri. - Who did I applyscent on my body for?Of course, for Gauri.- I'm wearing this watch. For who?Who is all this for?Who is all this for?Gauri...Hari... - Madam? - On your way, tellGopal to send a good electrician.The heaters are under repair.- Okay, madam.And what about the telephonebill? - I'll pay it, madam.I'll get the money. - No, there isbalance from what I took yesterday.Okay.'I want to go to the market.'Hair, please wait.Lakshmi wants to go shopping.Take her along.Okay, madam.- Bye.Buy me a dozen safety pins.Isn't this beautiful?Did you like it?I'll buy it for you.Keep it as a gift from me.You sketch so well.Continue to make sketches.The girl who is enchantedby the music from the flute.She is beautiful.'Are there beautiful girlsin your class?'Can anyone be as beautifulas you, Lakshmi?'Can anyone be as beautifulas you, Lakshmi?'Can anyone be as beautifulas you, Lakshmi?'Fantastic!I surrender to you.No, it's late night.And I need to study for my exam.Good night.Gauri...I asked you to get safety pins.Did you get it for me?Oh, no...I completely forgot.Yeah, right.You forgot the pins or me?Gauri,why are you being so rude?- I want to learn that game.Will you teach me now or not?Are you kidding?I have an exam tomorrow.I need to study.And you want me toteach you chess now?You won't like to play with me.On seeing her play chess,you smile at her.If a house help comes,you will only feel likeshouting at her.Hello, sir.- Hello.Madam...- What?Doctor isn't at home.Come in the morning to see her.I am not here to see a doctor ornurse.

Why do I care?We have other thingsto worry about.Sir, your braveryis being put to test.What is it? - A man iswaiting outside to kill you.What will you do?- Entire Maduraicity shivers on hearing my name.Is someone here to kill me?That one isn't sharp enough.Here, take this sickle.Come on.

More thanenough to woo the Lord girl.She wont goastray like that.I know her well.No other girl in Eka-landis as virtuous as her.If she was virtuous,why did she love Perumalayan ?You saw them returnafter the wedding.Guess who's bringing the orchid-coveredbed for Perumalayan?Its Kanthan.Kanthan is even more qualifiedin using black magic.....to seduce women, better than Perumalayan.So what can I do ?We must break the bondbetween Perumalayan and Kanthan.How ?When alcohol touches his tongue,Kanthan's tone and behaviour changes.Gets to partying and dancing.Then its just a prod away.Today's celebration willgo to shambles.Since I'm with them,I may not be able to do it.But everyone wouldrecognize me.Put on a beardand moustache.And a wig and costumeNo one except Perumalayanwill be in their wits by then.Join in only after thedrinking and singing has begun.I'll smoothly removePerumalayan from the scene.Lord.. get ready forthe game.After Perumalayan kicksout Kanthan,...Tamara has only oneperson to go to.This one.Where were you?When we reached Kekkammarwe realized we forgot to bring it.What ?- 'It'. Then we found a shop somehow.Are you going to roastand eat all these ?Master, shouldnt you be advisingthe kids against this?What's in your hand?- Its nothing.This is a wedding celebration,right ?Partying should beallowed today.Kannan, are you goingto drink too ?No.- Better not.What, what did youjust advise?That he can doanything he wants.We'll obey you girls only when the sun rises in the west.So shall we begin?- Let us !Where's the Master?Master !Master !I hand over thissilk robe to you.Guard it like treasure.This is as valuableas my life.Its been passed onthrough generations.The only heirloom I have.An old belief says that.... if we lose this, evenour relationship will fall apart.Beside the Vannaathi river..When the Moon gazes into the mirror..Oh lady, who came outpursuing her dream.By the red-flower garden.You, who threw outyour chest of pearls..On Thiruvathira night..you enter, like Goddess Parvati.Girl, this night, whomdo you seek ?As a wed girl..Why did you come tothe forest of flowers ?You are the full moon's light,out for its nightwalk.Am I not in your dreamsfilled with passion ?Did you see it ?Its ok, he didit unknowingly.What are you guys watching?Continue the song.Get away you !- What, what's happening ?He's hitting me !- Dont you escape !Get away from here.Let him go, let him go.Let him go.Please help.Perumalaya, he's hitting the Master !Perumalayan, pleasecome and help.Perumalayan, come fast.Kanthan !Leave him.Stop it !Let me go.Stop it.Perumalayan, I didntdo anything.Dont utter a word.Someone's trying tocreate trouble here.Enough, stop it.You're arrogantenough to beat Master?Perumalayan.. I..I dont wantyour justification.I.. I didnt do anything wrong.Our master comes from alineage of Manakkadan masters.You forgotall that?I.. Perumalayan.. I..Its all clearto me.When townspeople said it,I defended you.But no more.You shall not playroles in Eka-land anymore.If I hold any say over these forests,I hereby decree..Kanthan shall no longerplay the Theyyam here !Perumalayan.. I..Move away.I will say it only once.You shall not..play the Theyyam here any longer.Perumalayan.Kanthan.I lost everything.How can I live withoutplaying the Theyyam anymore?What are you guyswatching ? Leave !Kanthan, be calm.We'll find a solution to this.No..Perumalayan never goesback on his words.But Perumalayan has lost outto only one person.That person caninfluence Perumalayan.Who is that ?- Tamara.When she tells him....the 'Lord of Fire' Perumalayanwill obey.But.. I..Nothing wrong in it.Tomorrow, go tell heryour sorrows.You didnt do iton purpose, right?It was justan accident.She'll speakon your behalf.And Perumalayan willlisten to her, too.Your ban willbe lifted.Are you sureabout this ?I swear on myTheyyam role.The Perumalayan will listenif she says.I didnt think artists can givesuch a good beating.This too shall pass,Lord Unni.Scars take time to heal.No pain, no gain.This isnt magic.Its plain human brilliance.It never fails to work.Our plan is movingahead, right ?Kanthan beatyou up.In return, wegot Kanthan bannedI dontunderstand it.Guess I'll end up returning toKodagu penniless.Just because I trusted your words.- True.I deserve to hear this, eh?For all that I had planned for you.Kanthan's bond withPerumalayan is broken.Now Kanthan will go after Tamara.Requesting his ban be lifted.The more she requests it, theworse his suspicions will get.When his character's dark sidebegins to show, she will hate himShe rejected her comfortable Lord housewithout thinking of it.Tamara will become so remorsefulof that decision.And she willturn to Lord Unni.I dreamt for allthis to happen.But now...I wasn't accusingyou, Paniyan.Calm down.- No, I think I'll leave now.I think I'll meet Perumalayanand tell him the truth.Poor Tamara.. let hercontinue living with Perumalayan.Paniyan, dont get so hurt.Come here.Let's end this friendship, Lord.You'll lose your money, honour..And you'll end up hurt.I dont careabout all that.Tired of all this.How much money you need?I'll give you.No need.Look at me.My only wish isto get Tamara.But.. you suspectedme. I'm hurt.I'll touch your feet in repentance.- What are you doing ?Here, keep this.Paniyan stronglysuggested it to me.Divine force acted through him,sending me to you.My mind feels free now,like a forest cleared.Paniyan is a nice man.Always trying to help.Ya right. He really onlylooks after his own interests.That's the real him.There's a medic in Maruthawho can treat infertility.For 2 years, I've been tellingwe should go meet him.How unpredictably things are changing.Sorrows enter amidstour laughter.All that feels likesome magical illusion to me.Some bearded guy sneaksbehind me in that darkness.Did he come to steal?Or did he get the wrong guy somehow ?Then it was all shouting.I dont recollect anything.Tamara..Please request Perumalayanto remove my ban.If you say it, he wont refuse it.I'm sure.Sure. I'll remove hisanger today itself.I interpret it comes from his disgust towards your drinking.He doesn't love you any less.Just because of disgust,he alienated me to this extent ?If he decides to give allmy rights and roles to someone else..That wont happen.I also want your previousbond to be restored.Cheerma is my witness.I swear to you...If it works out, what willyou give me for mediating ?Bottle of liquormight work.Let me leave.What ?Isnt that Kanthan ?(Tamara: wonder why he left soon)- Perumalayan: Yes.This doesn't look good.Why ?Why did he run on seeing you ?What are you implying ?Hmm. Maybe its nothing.What ?- Its nothing.Hubby is coming.I should leave.Kannan Perumalayan's wifenow plays mediator to many.For whom ?- Kanthan.It was an accident.His face makes it obvious,he isn't lying.Let him first stopdrinking alcohol.During the time we startedloving each other..I used to have a bad opinion of you.Kanthan defended you, spoke highly of you,and changed my opinion.I am sad for him.Lets see.Did you want to say something ?No.. just that..Felt like I should be saying something.Remember to say itwhen I'm back.This is my first playafter the wedding.When I think of gettingonto the fire, a bit of fear..Dont know why.. this is the first time.Wait.Dont call backa man set on his task.Why are you flirtingaround here now, PerumalayanWe have stops to makebefore the play.When you're in love, thesesmall things are such a joy.You're gettinginto the fire.Be careful.Dont be afraid, girl.Please come, Perumalayan.What happened to you Paniyan?- Nothing.I've been thinking stuff.Is it about Cheerma ?You know I neverthink about myself.I just dont want my lovedones to be hurt.Say, Perumalayan...Did Tamara knowKanthan earlier ?It was Kanthan who helpedus with our relationship all along.If not for him, I dont know whetherour relationship would have lasted.I see. I thought they didntknow each other earlier.I see.What is it Paniyan?- Oh, nothing.Its really nothing.I'm just.. nah.It cant be possible.No.. you're thinking of something.How can I speculate what's on my mindwihout any evidence ?I'm sure there's somethingyou're hiding.Speak it, Paniyan.Dont worry about evidence now.But how can I tell itto your face.. no.Is it about Kanthan ?Do you suspect Kanthan of something ?Suspect.. maybe..Maybe I'm just imagining it.My mind is dirty,thinks bad things.So be it.Just say it anyway.Based on what I know...No.. its not appropriate..Dont get me mad withcuriosity, Paniyan.I cant bear it.Whatever hell it is,just open up and let it loose.Ok I'll say it.You do know I love you, right.I believe so.Not just you, but Tamara too.Kanthan loves me too.Its what I believe.Who can say what the truth isor who is hiding behind lies.When he gets drunk,Kanthan loses control.But when sober,would he ever cheat me ?No he wont. Until we findevidence, you continue to trust in himYou dont trust Kanthan.Its written on your face.If you're a good friend,speak openly to me.You wouldnt allowme to be cheated.I wont allow it !But I dont want tobackbite another friend either.That's why I'm confused.So I'm being cheated !?Its wrong of you tohide it any longer.If you do that,you are my enemy.Lets say a womancheats on her husband.If your woman.. no I'm nottalking about Tamara here..If the husband discovers it and kicks her outof his life, the problem is solved.But if he continues to love herdespite knowing what she's upto.....then his heart is just hell.What's the meaning of all this?Tell me.Tell me clearly.No, Paniyan.Before I suspect her,I need tangible evidence.Happy to hear that.Atleast now I have a chanceto show my love and loyalty to you.I cant say aboutevidence now.You.. be carefulabout your wife.Observe how she interactswith Kanthan.Just stay alert,no need to suspect yet.I know the behaviourof women in Eka-land.They hide unspeakable thingsfrom their husbands.Is this your opinion ?Remember what Tamara's fathercursed in front of the Rulers ?\"She betrayed her own father,she may betray you too.\"What nonsense I'm saying here.I just spoke out oflove for you.Forgive me.I'm indebted to you forever.I think I've causedyou grief, Perumalayan.No, not at all.Dont cause problemsbecause of what I said.I meant.. keep your suspicionshidden, but be alert.I wont cause problems.Kanthan is my close friend.If you make any issues..you're looking so hurt.No.. I'm fine.I still believe Tamara is loyal.Live and let live. Think that,and survive on.I wonder, would she do something like that ?Exactly, that's the point.Let me be frank.She rejected proposals from somany Lords, to be with you.When she compares those handsome choices against your face,....dont you think sheresents it ?True.If you learn anything more,let me know.Tell Cheerma towatch out, too.Dont be hurt bywhat I said.Its good to remove theban on Kanthan. He is talented.But if you keep the ban for a while......we will know if onlyTamara who thinks this way.We'll see if your girlputs up a fight for Kanthan.We can conclude manythings from that.For now, just keep itas a suspicion.Assume Tamara iscompletely loyal.I beg you.(Prayer to Goddess)Why are youlooking dull ?Why didnt you tellme you had returned?I have a headache.Let me put some balmon your forehead.Does the color makeme look uglier ?No, not at all.How can you everlove this face ?I never found anyflaws with this face.If ever, the more I see it,the better it looks to me.My fortune.Tired of playing the clown.With your help, we canremove all our problems.What do you want me to do ?We may never get thisopportunity again.Have you seen whereit is kept ?If I get it, I can make allour dreams happen.You always say I'm stupid.So explain to this stupid one, please.What gains can you makefrom just a silk robe ?You needn't know details.Each year brings Kannan's familymore and more progress.Kannan's family fortunehas been like that.No other family has made steady progress up the ladder.Each new son is bornwith 10 new talents.Dont we also wish for ason who is talented ?Dont I need a reprievefrom this clown role ?Atleast for once, asolo main role.I want to play Theechamundi too.Doesn't every artist wish for praiseand gifts from the Rulers ?Dont you wish these things too ?Right now, all that isin your hands.Only you can get that silk robeby getting info from Tamara.Maybe not forever. We'llkeep it just for one day.Just one day. What say ?Do you remember your mother ?No.I have only seen adamaged photo of hers.Mother was beautiful.You must have inheritedher beauty then.I dont think I'm beautiful. ButKannan keeps insisting otherwise.Perumalayan is fortunate.I believe I am the fortunate one.Frankly, I am so enviousof both your fortunes.I've never been happy foreven one day after marriage.I cant even become a Mother.It will all turn out ok.Just tie a cradle in Flower forest.All my wishes come true when I do that.Wait here a moment, I'll be back.Where are you going, I'll join you.- No, nowhere.I'll start the fire on the stove and be back.Cheerma..Where has she gone ?Cheerma.Cheerma.Laughing ?I feel terrible doing this.I cheated her.Still, this laughter makes up for it..I know you'd do anythingto make me happy.Perumalayan.What rubbish you told me yesterday.I haven't slept well.Not able to.When eyes close, images of what you saidflash in front of my eyes.Why did you do thisto me, Paniyan?Why are you overthinking this ?I only said I had a doubt.Your 'doubt'.Never come to me again.You've trapped me ina well I will drown in.The spectators of Kaliyattam (play) andthe artists can all crave for her.I would rather be ignorant of it.But now I am...I've lost all my joyand peace of mind.To all my play roles..To all the fires I have danced to...I bid goodbye to you, who made me great.To the drumbeats whogave me passion...To the flutes who infusedGod into me.I am beginning toseparate from you.The Gods shall no longer resideon Perumalayan's fingers.What, have you gone mad ?Yes, you made me a madman.You must prove to methat my wife is an infidel.I want tangible proof.If you cant, I swear on the Gods,I will kill you !What have I...- I dont want to hear it.I want to see evidence.Your allegations against herare now burning me in fire.So you must die.May God help you, then.I shall not playany roles anymore.I dont want to livein a world of lies.Sincerity and innocence areno longer valued here.Thank you for making meunderstand that.Friendship is a sin. I wontbefriend anyone anymore.Paniyan.No need Perumalayan, I'm done.Paniyan, stop.I agree, you are a true friend.Its ok.\"My wife is an infidel.\"I must both believe it andnot believe it, at the same time.I trust you, but I need evidence.You want evidence ?I really need it.I'll give you.You want tangible evidence, right ?I'll give it.I have no peace of mind..Why are you so depressed ? You'rea renowned singer Panicker.You are healthy,have a girl who loves you.If I can't participate inTheyyam, what use is marriage.No girl can love a drunkard.You are going to lose me! BewareAre you 2 fighting?If you touch liquor, it's off between us.My parents can find me another groom.Damayanti..Damayanti has a point, Kantha.Poor her..Lost everything.Job.Peace of mind.Now Damayanti too left me-Dont worry. God wont forsake good people.GoneWhat is it, child?Nothing.So are you cryingfor no reason?If I tell you something,will you scold me ?Ofcourse not.My child, tell me what happened.I cant find it now. He gave itto me the day I arrived here.What are utalking about?That silk robe. I'd kept it safely.Dont know how I lost it.Did you search everywhere, child?- Yes.What do I tellhim now?Dont need to tell himfor now. Go search, firstWhat's the secret?-Cheerma, did you see the red silk robe?It's missing for 2 days. I'm lucky Kannan hasn't asked me yetWhat do I do now?-Dont worry. It should bearound here somewhere.He wouldn't remember amidst preparations for the fest.-Exactly.I cant lie to Kannan-You needn't lie. Wait a few days.I'll find it for you.From where?-From somewhere.Be calm, Tamara.We want to hold a mega fest in VilapuramGods are enraged.Epidemics returning to the village.Crops and pets dying.Love between humans has died as well-It has been postponed for long.I'd like to do a big one this year, andcontinue an annual Kaliyattam (Play of God)Perumalayan, can you lead this?Sure.- Go ahead with it then.We will make plansand inform you of preparations.Ur play is on December 10.Its a grand Kaliyattam,we want you to personally perform.I have not performedthe big one yet, due to my caste.Doesn't matter, you are up to it.Moreover, during divination,the Gods favored you.So be it- Alright. We take our leave.Come with me.Dont forget my word.I will give you....real evidence before the bigplay is over. I promise.Oh God !What have you done !What's happened to Kannan?-Dont know. First time I see him so angry.Something troubling his mind.Why else would he throw the token fee?Yes, I agree.- His mind must be purewhen performing the fire dance.If not, the fire will burn his mind.The heat will seep in.They say even the performer'swife must do fasting for himI'm ready to doany fasting for him.Your willingness to fastitself is enough, child.Pray for his mindto be alright.Oh God.I pray Paniyan is unable tofind evidence before Kaliyattam ends.(prayers)As high as Blue mountains,and as low as the valley.The roots of the nativeBanyan tree grow.In all coves where divine lamp is litTheyyam will mark its presence in February.Forgive me.Dont.I have begunmy fast..Let the big performanceget over.

I'm quite depressedbeing alienated from the play.You have been cheatingme for so long.Lord Unni. I was justplanning to meet up with you.I've lost what I lost.I'm going to end upa complete loser here.Lost my time.. my money. I now understand..it was all in vain. I'll never get Tamara.First learn to trust in yourself,then question others.This fire of doubt willweaken you, Lord.Clown !- Get lost !See? This is my state now.I have several bettercharacters I can play.Bhairavan of Naalankandam,Aaroli Ruchittan.Honestly speaking, eventhe Villavaram role.God is watching everything.The role of Vilavram Bhagavatharwill find its way to me soon.I get the feeling I'm irrelevant here.I'll end up bottom of the list.- No, things have progressed.Almost within arm's reach now!All that's left is for me to grab herand drop her in your lap.You are bluffing.- No.Then let me hear it.Come straight to the point.You may decidedate and time.Are you serious?-Yes.I'll go to Kodagu hills first.And buy a pepper plantation for us.And build a house.-Good plan.Dont remain herewith Tamara.The Lord and Madam's marriage...Kodagu Hills it is!Here.. give thisto my Tamara.This is the last time Igive courier service.I cant be your messengeralways, ok?You 2 are only botheredabout yourselves.Always talking about romancewith each other.Once you take her to Kodagu,will you care about me?You think I'd everforget you, Paniya?Kantha, I've beensearching for you.Whose camp is this?- Ambupanickan.His Theyyam is tomorrow.Playing 'Bhairavan'.Since I have no role,I decided to do this.I hear the big playwill be a big hit.As Perumalayan said, in Eka-landno one can match our troupe's fame.You may feelproud and happy.But how long must I remainuseless like this.I was all alone today.No one to even speak to.Damayanti is alsomissing.No one fromhome either.Mom considers meher enemy.This too shall pass.Hold the goddess tightly in your heart.Where'd you get this robe?-Fell into my hands by luck!Looks beautiful.-Dont know where it came from.When I awoke, the robewas in my lap.I'm not kidding, Paniya.Feels like a dream.Anyway, some relief for meafter this robe came to me.Stopped drinking.I'll give it toDamayanti if she comes.She'd be happy.True.She'd be happy.There.Around it, there.Like that.Wrap it aroundAbout the lamp, I'd asked...-Dont bother, they'll manage itOk- PerumalayanWrap it close together.What is it?Did you have a red silk robe with u?Not 'had', Istill have it.Really? Correct thatto 'had', not 'have'.What are you saying?-Listen to me patiently.Give me your word on that- Tell meThat silk robeis with Kanthan.Saw it with my own eyesDont be weak.I'm there for you.I promise on Villavaram goddess,I'll support you for anything.I can understandyour situationI myself felt so hurt whenI realized u're being cheated.So I can guess thepain you are undergoing.Must kill him.Yes, but dont doanything to her.Her too !- If you kill him, she becomes yours.She who cheatsmust not live.Ok, I'm with you.I only regret I cant killboth of them twice for you.But it's not time yet. Must thinktwice before making such decisionsThis is not child's play. It's murder.Not some cat or dog. Homicide.I'm still not convinced.The robe mightstill be with her.She must nothave given it.You must haveimagined it.She cannotgive it away.I searched the housefully before I came here.Not sure where thatrobe went.How can I tell Kannan it is lost ?For now, dont tell himI believe it'll be foundbefore Kaliyattam is over.I can bear losinganything else...Thank God he believes me blindly-Does Perumalayan ever doubt u?No, neverDoubt would notenter even his dreams.Here he comes.I'm going to insist thathe allow Kanthan back.I'll be indoors.Your hands are wet.Maybe becauseI'm very happy.You must observe a fast too.Hot sweaty hands.I'm donning a costumeand jumping into fire.The Malayan's wifemust have purity too.I am fasting too. Justdidn't inform you.I'd done the same fastingto get wed to you.Be careful.These are hands thatoffered your heart to me.Dont take excessivefreedom with it.Beware.What about theissue I asked you about ?What ?I told Kanthan todaythat I'd make everything alright.I am leavingfor the temple.Oh, where isthat robe?Robe.. er.. I thinkit's at home.Tell the truth.Where is it?It is mostvaluable to me.It is my lifeU're changing the topicto avoid my request.Cant you takeKanthan back ?I ask you, whereis that robe !?Cant you make thingsalright for Kanthan?Where is that robe ?Seriously, I think it was your mistake.-Oh God !The Perumalayan doubtsu, Tamara.I've never seenhim like this.That robe ismagical or something.Sad that I lost it.What should I do ?It's ok, child.Maybe the robe was justan excuse to get angry.Male mind is notas we think.First, they love greedily. As days pass,they grow tired and avoid us.No Cheerma,Kannan is not like that.It is my mistakeI hope it's as you say.Awaiting the Hero she was, fasting..Chembarathy, beautiful as a peacock featherDawns passed, dusk passed..She alone survived without foodJust to see the Heroonce more...she awaited inpain and patience.(Repeat)In the deep cavernsof Kudagu hills, he was.7 obstacles, 17 hillsstood facing the HeroAfter he crossed them, a conch was blown- The Lord honored the Hero.Many full-moons passed.The storm blew awaythe lamps of the school.While Hero was seething in anger, Kudagan'shands stabbed him behind his back.My tears swelled up, flooded my mind city.My cries were loud, my mind's fort broke down.Hearing Hero's story, she burned in pain.Chembarathy, as beautiful as a peacock feather.Many dawns passed, her friends left her.She decided to jump into the fire herself.She flew like a bird,close by the Hero's side.So you haven't seenanything suspicious?Not only that,I dont doubt her at all.But you told me you sawher with Kanthan?I heard what they spoke. Nothinginappropriate in that conversation.But they spoke somethingwhile you were away.Nothing bad has happened.I can vouch, Tamara's not an infidel.If someone told you otherwise,I curse him with destruction!Honestly, u're luckyto have got Tamara.Leave.Ask her to come here.Ettan, had you called ?Let me see your eyes.Look at my face.What happened to you, Ettan?I dont understandwhat u're saying.You look pale.Who are you ?- Your wife.Promise me you haven'tcheated me.I promise on the Goddess.I could never do that.But the gods have seenyour treachery.No! What mistake areyou accusing me of?Go. Go away from me.Your eyes are watery.Is it because of me ?My girl, why areyou so beautiful ?I'm burningbecause of your beauty.Oh Goddess, forgive meYou please forgive me.Forgive me.I still love you.What trash he hasthought up!Dont cry, child.He must'vemisunderstood somewhere.You still trust him?I have no one.I can do nothingbut cry.Tamara, are you crying?What happened?How can she not !? Perumalayanhas been blabbering a lot of nonsensePerumalayan would normallynot do that...Dont cry, childShe ran away from herpalace home for him.So sad that she hasto hear such things.I know I'm unlucky.There's a limit todoing nonsense.Why should you bear everythingjust because he's Perumalayan?Dont cry !What should I do tochange his mind?I know he must behaving good intentions.Please tell him I apologize forerrors I may have done.Forgive him, child. I'llchange his mind, I promise !Am I seeing and hearingthe truth, Paniya?Would my Tamaragive that away?Here he goes again !You know, you cant visually seethis thing called virginity.Imagine her lying alongsideKanthan with that robe...If something of thatsort happens...I've heard and seen it.Men like to boast of suchrelationships, like their trophies.What did he say ?He.. and Tamara..Perumalaya.. what happened.What's happened?This is the 2nd time. He fellyesterday too. Maybe epilepsy.No, I doubt it.Come, let's pick him upNo need. He'll recover witha little rest. Get some water.No, I...- Go, go now !How are u?Alright?What, are you sarcastic?-No, I'm serious !Now what if you had personallywitnessed all I described?Was he speaking the truth?-U're a man, dont be a wimp.Many men are cheatedaround the world like this.I pity you. you still lay withthe woman who cheated you.If I were in your position,I would have taken measures.U're right about all this.Stay away fromhere for a while.When you were unconscious,Kanthan had come here.I've asked him toreturn here.You can eavesdrop,while I talk.I'll bring up 'the topic'with him. Observe his expressions.Observe while he describes..how many times where..when.. with your wife..This shall be the evidence.Dont attempt totake revenge immediately.Ok.But.. I want to kill himThere's time for that.Dont do it now. Hide for now.Go..I'll ask Kanthan about Damayanti now.He will speak happily.The love-crazy Perumalayan will thinkthat we're talking about Tamara.Where's Perumalayan?- He left.How's he now ?He's fine. I told you its nothing.Give me that.So, what news on yourside, my Panicker boy.When I hear 'Panicker',I get reminded that....I lost thatpost in the play.Dont worry man. Keep behindthat Tamara.She would've fixed thisfor you long ago.If you had told Damayanti...poor girl, eh !A girl who loves a manso much ! Poor her.We are deeply in love.She came to me,sometime ago.Feel like seeing her,wherever I go.She followed me to the fair,the other night.Then we lied down on mymat together. Didn't want to ask her to leave.We hugged tight and sleptThere's Damayanti.Why did you come here?- 'Why' ?To see your whore! you giftedme her silkrobe it seems.Never thought uwere so cheap !What are udoing, Damayanti !Go appease her, Panicker.Damayanti, listen tome first !I dont want to hear anything.Dont follow me now.Stop, Damayanti.

I saw it.Oh Goddess !Oh Goddess !What should I do now ?What mistake did I do ?That I loved her morethan my own life ?Or that I kept praying toGods, stepping on the embers....while my insideswere still burning ?Tell me..u who have thrownthe seeds of epilepsy at me!You who gave mea heart of excessive love.Tell me..What do I do now?Tonight I mustkill her.Get me some poison.You must notkill with poison.Strangle her while she's asleep.Ok.

He's been murdered !Help !He's killing !That's the reason.I'm convinced of it.Oh stars in the sky..I dare not tell you the reasonI shall notspill her blood.Shall not land a scratchon her body, softer than a snowflake.She must die.I shall put out this lamp.I shall turn offthis light.If my lantern goes out,I can rekindle it.But if I put out that beautiful'lamp' there,I can never rekindle it !If I pluck this silent rose flower,I cannot give it life again.Before the flower falls.. let meenjoy its beauty.

Besides-What?The village and the villagers are all here.What's the point of this hunt?Even if you can nab the scorpion monster,how will you punish it?Did it kill people or steal their powers?What's wrong with you today?Just do as you usually would in hunts.Let's go hunting.Get your filthy hands off me.Didn't you find me a nuisance?I'm not going.Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?I was excited about hunting monstersbecause they were eviler than me.Yes, you can gain fame andearn respect from such deeds.But what about me?Not only did I lose my power, butI even have to hide my identity.I can't even eat meat when I'm with you.If I want a bite of meat,I have to do it secretly.What do I even gain?This is all for your benefit.Listen up.Without my protection,you would be dead by now.Don't think so highly of yourselfjust because of your meager powers.Listen up, I can cultivatemy powers without you.Yes, I owe your father and youreleven martial uncles an apology.But we're even now thatyou turned me into this!We're square now! I'm going my own way!Farewell! Forever!Eat up.Big Brother, have you noticed?The villagers here areconcealing something.Have they been bewitchedby the scorpion monster?Is that why we can't find any traces of it?It's indeed very strange.The innkeeper is especially so.We must find the scorpionmonster as soon as possible.By the way,I think the bride of YanChixia is suspicious.During our fight withthe Immortal Dog Guard,she looked just like a wolf.Do you think Yan Chixia ishiding something from us too?Even with the greatest power,Yan Chixia can't possiblyturn Red Wolf into a human.Big Brother, I think it's possible.Only the Yuchi clan has theability to seal monsters.Besides, Yan Chixia'spowers are above ours.I've secretly kept watch onhim for the past few days.He has brought along magicaltools and a compass for this trip.This means that evenwithout the imperial edict,he would've come to hunt thescorpion monster on his ownand sought rewards from His Majesty.In addition, I think this fraudsteris just like his deceased father.They covet demonic powers bysealing demons and monsters.Big Brother, should we...Big Brother, I agree with Zishuang.The Monster Slaying Bureau hasalready lost His Majesty's trust.We must not cause unnecessary trouble.Wait for me here.If I'm not back in two hours,report to His Majesty andrequest reinforcements.Big Brother!Please be careful.What's going on? Why is my heart racing?Oh my goodness!This jerk has been lusting over me.No wonder he turned me into ahuman and keeps me by his side.Damn pervert.What should I do?If he gets rough, how can I resist him?What should I do?Is she continues to delay us,Ye Tianqing will claim the entirescorpion monster for himself.Rape!If you scream, I'll exorcize you.Let's go.Hey! Didn't Big Brotherask us to wait for him?Look at you.Why did you remove theinvisibility talisman?You know that the toilet stench canonly hide your smell temporarily.Why are you so wilful?The imperial court's monsterslayers have sniffed you out.If you continue being so obstinate,you'll doom the entire village.Even you'll lose your life.All right.From now on, ignore everything outside.You aren't allowed to leave the dark room.Otherwise, even the gods can't save you.Don't be afraid.I'll figure out a way to makethose monster slayers leave.What's going on?Ever since we arrived here, yourprecious tool has been wonky.Are you sure you can do this?My compass isn't malfunctioning.The scorpion monster is just too powerful.Roast duck!Where are you going?Sir, I want two!This one! This one too!I want both of them!- Do you want one too?- No!I'm on a diet!Forget it.Why? I've already chopped it up!They're too hideous!Miss, I've already chopped it up!Miss!- Fresh buns!- Buns!I want to eat buns!I want 80 grams.Come on.You haven't paid!Why are you tailing me?Who are you? Are you a monster?What I am doesn't matter.You should be more concernedabout your foolishness.You even let your father's murderer flee.What an unfilial son.Preposterous.What are your motives?You're devoted to the imperial court,but the emperor doesn't trust you.Yan Chixia isn't even an official,but his name is known to all.He's adored by the emperor and the people.Why is that?That's because he has theblood of the Yuchi clan.He can use forbidden artsto gain demonic powers.You can't.He should've been sentenced to death,but the emperor didn'teven pronounce him guilty.Instead, he was assignedan important mission.As the chief of the Monster Slaying Bureau,you should understandthe emperor's intentions.So what?His Majesty is wise.As subjects, we shouldn'tspeculate his intentions.Speculate?The emperor is doing this so that Yan Chixiacan take over the Monster Slaying Bureau.Ye Tianqing.Will you let your father'smurderer trample over you?You'll be a laughing stock of the world.Who's that person in black?The scorpion monster's poweris greater than Red Wolf's.If you can nab the scorpion monster,I can help you obtain power tentimes greater than Yan Chixia.The title of State Preceptor will be yours.You'll dominate overall except the emperor.Who's there?That was a close shave.What the hell is Ye Tianqing up to?Let's keep this a secretto avoid suspicion.The scorpion monster has appeared.Let's go.Scorpion monster, I'll find you.Wait!I have something to tell you.What is it?This bun is delicious. Want a bite?Enjoy it yourself. I'm goingto hunt the scorpion monster.Do you think the villagechief made the right decision?I'm jittery.We have no say about this.Just forget about it.Let's not talk about it. Come on.Scorpion monster, you finally showed up.You can't get away from me.What a wretched seller.The stone in the bun almost broke my fang!Wait for me!You scared me.You're never gentle.Look what I found.The scorpion monster is taking a shower.A monster taking a shower?Shut up and move it.No way.The innkeeper is the scorpion monster?A hairless and plump scorpion.I bet you're just hungry.Why is there only one person here?Take her away!She isn't dead, is she?Stop. Get back.Wake up.Get up.Time to eat meat.Are you okay? Wake up.Wake up!You died so easily?Wake up.Wake up!Are you all right?Are you okay?Why are you laughing? Get down.Come on. What's going on?Tell me, where is the scorpion monster?To be honest, I'm the scorpion monster.You're the scorpion monster?This is bullshit.Listen up, release thescorpion monster now.Otherwise, I'll make areport to the imperial court.I'll say that Yueling Villageis colluding with a monster.All of you will be beheaded.Run! Go!Are you okay?I'm fine.Crimson Snow Dragon.Seal.Ye Tianqing, what are you doing?That's my question for you.Did you try to hunt the monsterin secret to gain its powers?How dare you harm my man!Run!Go!Big Brother, the scorpion escaped.Let's go!Take it down!Utter trash.Yan Chixia, you're preventingme from hunting the monster.Do you want me to make a report toHis Majesty for your death sentence?Big Brother, he's shieldingthe scorpion monster.It's clear that he's opposing us.Quite on the contrary!Chief Ye is concealing something.You aren't here to hunt monsters.You have other motives!Yan Chixia, enough with the slander!He's right!If he didn't protect me,you would've killed me!Miss, you can't spout lies!Master Yan colluded with the villagersto protect the scorpion monsterand oppose the imperial court.Spit it out! What are you plotting?Don't make me the scapegoat!Fine, we can meet His Majesty.You shouldn't have beenso nice to Ye Tianqing.He's clearly in cahootswith that person in black.You should've just exposed him.What good will that do for us?The villagers see us as their companions.They don't see us as their companions.See, he's here to cause trouble.Yan Chixia.I'm here to tell you thatI'm aware of your plans.His Majesty might think highly of you,but don't forget this.The Yuchi clan stole 11lives of the Zodiac Warriors.You're well aware of theYuchi clan's sacrifices.His Majesty, too.Here's a piece of advice. Finish your task.Don't play with fire andend up burning yourself.I'm an honorable man.I won't be manipulated by others.That includes you, Yan Chixia.Watch your back.You're the guilty one! Whyare you glaring at others?Hey, you...Miss Wolf.Master Yan, can we have a private chat?This way, please.Big Brother, I'm perplexed.Why have you been tolerating Yan Chixia?If he wants to oppose us,officials like us don'thave to fear a bumpkin.Exactly!The village chief is the key tolocating the scorpion monster.Come this way.Please.Just up ahead.Please come in.Please have a seat.Village Chief, why did you inviteso many people to a simple meal?You're being too optimistic.Someone so mean can'tpossibly treat us to a meal.I invited you here to tell you something.Actually...Actually, the scorpion monster didn'tkill anyone in Yueling Village.On the contrary, it saved all of us.- Yes.- That's right.The scorpion monster saved us from doom.It's true. It saved us.Here's what happened.The scorpion monster committedgreat evil in the past.Master Nanwu sealed itunder Yueling Temple.He predicted that the scorpionmonster would reemerge 20 years later.So, he set off to capture it again.Unexpectedly, he witnessed thescorpion monster saving the village.Brother Scorpion.This is for you.Amitabha.Thank you, young man.Come this way.Be careful.I really owe you my thanks.Watch your step.Master Nanwu was moved by thescorpion monster's kindness.Hence, he set up an enchantment to sealall kind monsters in Yueling Village.He wanted monsters andhumans to live in harmony.In a bid to prevent greedysorcerers from causing trouble,Master Nanwu set traps outside the village.He hoped that these would deter them.In fact, not all monstersare evil and brutal.Human greed and violence sparked theresentment between themselves and monsters.Master Yan, I really wish theimperial court can be mercifuland leave Yueling Village alone.Do you think this crappy story can stopme from hunting the scorpion monster?I bet the scorpion monsterhas devoured your souls.Nonsense!Humans and monsters have beenenemies since ancient times.A harmonious relationship is impossible.You're just using this chance to rebel.You've committed such serious crimes.How dare you speak such honeyed lies.If you don't hand overthe scorpion monster,the imperial court will sendtroops to destroy Yueling Village.What? Destroy us?When the disaster occurred,the city's guards fled in desperation.They didn't care about our lives.How dare you threaten uswith the imperial courtand flaunt your authority here!Piss off! Leave Yueling Village!Leave! Scram!Silence!Stubborn fools!What are you doing?I'm warning you.The scorpion monster is mine.If you ruin my plans,Miss Red Wolf will die.Red Wolf?- Why is Red Wolf here?- Wasn't Red Wolf sealed?Will she eat us?So what if you're an official?Officials give no shit about the people.Isn't that right?Why can't humans andmonsters live in harmony?Why can't love bloom between them?That's right.She's Red Wolf.But after she was sealed by me,we spent every day togetherand love blossomed.Look, isn't she cute?So, I'm going to resist the governmentand the imperial court with you.So, you're the son of General Yuchi!Yan Chixia, with your help,Yueling Village will be saved.We'll be saved!Long live Yan Chixia!This worked?Once Ye Tianqing leaves, thescorpion monster is mine.Big Brother, are you really goingto let him take all the credit?Head back and gather theentire Monster Slaying Bureau.I'll show them the consequencesof defying the imperial court.Yes!Guys, follow my instructions.Step one.- Cleave.- Cleave!- Slash.- Slash!- Stab.- Stab!Good. One more time.- Cleave.- Cleave!- Slash.- Slash!- Stab.- Stab!Good. Train by yourself.Little girl, come here.Do you know where the scorpion monster is?I don't know.Continue training.Who's there? Show yourself.You sure are having it easy.Once you kill the villagers, youcan capture the scorpion monster.Yet, you gave this wonderfulchance to Yan Chixia.I was utterly wrong about you.Why don't you kill thescorpion monster yourself?You've tried to spark my resentmentfor Yan Chixia time and again.What are your motives?It's been a long time, Ye Tianqing.I should've figured out you were the one.Qiuhan, daughter of General Snake.When you were chosen forthe Monster Slaying Bureau,you were bent on training theforbidden blood sacrifice arts.In the end, you were dismissedby the imperial court.You even stole scrolls on forbidden arts.If my guesses are right,you were the one who summonedthe scorpion monster.Yes, that's right.Heavens above and earthunder Mount Yueling.Ancient monsters comeforth to rumble nature.Scorpion monster, I'll freeyou from your seal today.I will establish a blood contract with you.You must abide by my wishes.If you break this contract,your thousand-year cultivation will be destroyed,and you'll turn into a normal scorpion.Do you agree?I spent all my power to master necromancyand avenge my mother.Ye Tianqing, have you forgottenabout your father's death?Don't you hear the villagers' cries?Long live Yan Chixia.You've resented him since childhood.Are you willing to be trampled over by him?The power of Blood Sacrifice Artsare above the Yuchi clan's blood.If you acquire such power,you can do more thanavenge your father's death.You can also become the State Preceptor.Of course.If Yan Chixia capturesthe scorpion monster,you'll lose everythingyou're about to gain.Consider wisely.I will only do my dutyto keep the peace of the world.I won't kill any innocent folks.If you hesitate any longer,you'll never realize your goals.Reviving the Tiger clanwill remain a fantasy.Look at them.What's wrong? Do you stillwant to be a wolf demon?When I was a demon,I committed many unforgivable crimes.Now that I'm thinking back on that,I really regret everything I did.I'm an orphan.My parents and brothers were hunted.I killed people to exact revenge on humans.I like this place.Some people are still wary of me,but this feeling of acceptanceis wonderful and unqiue.What do you call this?That's right.Home.I've made my decision.I'll stay here to protect these villagers.Thank you for everythingyou've done for me.Sister Wolf!Come and play with us.Let's go.Come on.Yikes.Humans are different from monsters.How could I ever fallin love with a monster?No, this won't do.Calm down.Young man, do you have time now?He looks suspicious. Whyare you looking for me?The scorpion monster is here.Coming.The toilet?Why are we here?Master, please come in.Wait.Village Chief, are you...interested in men?Wait, safety first.Forget it.Young man, don't get me wrong.I think I should join the dance.Come on.Come here.Village Chief, what arewe doing in the toilet?So, you hid the scorpion monster here.You used the toilet stenchto conceal its demonic aura.What a clever method.Village Chief, to be honest,this place is really disgusting.Master Yan, the Monster Slaying Bureau'sreinforcements will arrive tomorrow.Please help him.The scorpion monster looked hideous.Master Nanwu transformed himinto the young man you see now.It has 1,000 years of cultivation. Whydid Master Nanwu turn it into a young man?Well...Besides, if the scorpion monster is kind,why was your village threatenedwhen the rock seal was removed?Well...Village Chief.You're leading the villagersto resist the imperial court.Moreover, you're hidingthe scorpion monster.You're pretty bold.Are you guilty of something?Are you trying to make the scorpion monsteryour ally in the fight against your enemies?Master Yan, we're good people.That's enough. Let me seal it first.Seal it? That's akin to killing it!You know nothing.Scorpion monster, why aren'tyou revealing your true form?Was the Village Chief telling the truth?Am I wrong?Are you really a good monsteror is this a pretense?Leave! Go!You aren't welcome here! Leave!Get out!Who the heck are you?Leave.Get lost. You aren't welcome here.Village Chief, what's wrong?He wants to seal the scorpionmonster for the imperial court.He's horrible. Get lost.Yan Chixia, is that true?The toilet's stench won'thide its aura forever.I want to seal it inside my body.Once that's done, the imperialcourt will stop the hunt for it.But the Village Chief-What if you come acrossother monsters in the future?Will you seal all of them in your body?I'm clear about your tricks.I'm doing this for thebenefit of the villagers.Well, is the scorpionmonster willing to be sealed?A monster's feelings don't matter.- What about me?- You're a monster too...I didn't mean that.I mean...I think they have ulterior motives.I get it now.Everything you did wasn't for me.It was for yourself.I was such a fool.I thought that if I gave up my dignityas a monster to become a kind person,you won't mind my past and true form.But, in your eyes,I'm still that unforgivable wolf demonthat killed your fatherand ravaged Chang'an.Ye Tianqing is right.Monsters will always be monsters.We can't live in harmony with humans.Leave this place now!You aren't welcome here!Get lost!Scram!You aren't welcome here!Leave.I'm staying no matter what happens.I'll fight the Monster Slaying Bureauand the imperial court with them.That's because this placeis my home.Leave! You aren't welcome here!Get lost!Never come back!She's a friend.Don't be afraid.Relax.- Don't be scared.- She's one of us.I'm a monster too.Don't be afraid.Don't be scared.You needn't be terrified.I'm also a monster.We're square now! I'm going my own way!Farewell! Forever!What a bunch of fools!I was so polite to them.Why did they snap at me?How can humans andmonsters live in harmony?It's nothing but a fantasy.The Yuchi clan made countlesscontributions to the imperial court.In the end, our whole clan was slaughtered.The thought of this infuriates me.Especially that wolf girl.She's helping strangers!Strangers!Damn it!Let's go, my dear wife.When did I become your wife?Rape!Thank you for everythingyou've done for me.If you hesitate any longer,you'll never realize your goals.Reviving the Tiger clanwill remain a fantasy.Big Brother!Let's go!Capture every last one of them!Yes!Stop!Move it!Hurry up!Get moving!Keep up!Move it!Let me go!Be still!Where is the scorpion monster?Your life will be spared if you answer me.Don't move or I'll kill you!Ye Tianqing, let them go!Don't you want to hunt monsters?I'm a monster!Don't move.Don't think you can fool mewith this human disguise!Kill it!Ye Tianqing.The Heavens are merciful.Why must you kill it?It won't harm the world once it'ssealed and turned into a human.Yan Chixia.I feel disgraced for the Yuchi clan.You're pretending to be righteousjust to gain the monster's power.If you insist on defying theimperial court by stopping us,I won't show any mercy.You're far more disgraceful than me!You plotted with theperson in black for this!She's really the one.Do you know her? Why does shewant the scorpion monster?It's karma.Just tell me!It's all your fault!Monster!Get out of here!You should be sealed under a rock!That's right!Get out of our village!Leave!Let's go!One day, I'll crush allof you under a boulder!Actually, Master Yan didn'tharm the scorpion monster.I said that he wanted toseal it to chase him away.Do you know where he is? Take me to him!Well...- I know where he is.- Come on.Serpentine woman!I see, everyone is here.Ye Tianqing, you-Summoning the scorpion monster!Seal the Yuchi bloodline!The Heavens are on my side!Must you kill peoplejust for your ugliness?Do you know how it feels to bebullied and ostracized as a child?I'm an orphan too. I know best.But not every villager bullied you.Neither did the whole world bully you.Ye Tianqing, free me!It's useless to holler.This face is the very reasoneveryone treated me like a monsterand chased me out of the village.Since they think I'm a monster,I'll make this world pay in blood.I'll make them suffer horribly!The villagers have changed.I witnessed this.That's just because you're blind.If humanity isn't evil,monsters wouldn't exist.You've been hunting monsters for mankind.Have they ever shown you any gratitude?General Shenlong protected theimperial court with his life.Yet, his entire family was executed.You and I are dispensible pawns.Don't be naive.What about the scorpion monster?Did he ever cross you?He has a kind heart andsaved people from disaster.What about you?Take a good look at him.Impossible!At that time,Master Nanwu understood the reason forthe scorpion monster's reemergence.So, he turned it into a young manfor the villagers to look after.He wanted it to be nurtured well.The villagers were also given achance to atone for their mistake.Impossible! They'll never repent!You're lying!Qiuhan, we recognize our mistakes!Please spare the scorpionmonster and Master Yan!Give us a chance to make it up to you!It's too late.I'm a serpentine woman,an omen of catastrophe.Anyone who prevents the revivalof the Tiger clan will die.Big Brother.Ye Tianqing, get lost!How dare you fool me!Qiuhan! No!We're sorry for what we did toyou, but we can't continue erring.Get up!Yueling Village, I'll crush all ofyou under a boulder for eternity.Run!Yueling Village, I'll crush all ofyou under a boulder for eternity!Yueling Village, I'll crush all ofyou under a boulder for eternity!For eternity!Scorpion monster, you finally appeared.We are one. Devour me sothat we can be united.Yan Chixia!Why are you so stupid?You don't have any powers!Why did you save me?I'm a foolish monster.I want to return to your body.I want to see you worry over me.No!Yan Chixia, the scorpionmonster is battling her will.Take the opportunity to seal it.Otherwise, the villagers andthe village will be doomed.Big Brother.Let's go.[Grave of Red Wolf]His Majesty will bestowrewards for this battle.Brother Yan, are you sure you don'twant to join the Monster Slaying Bureau?His Majesty is alreadywary of the Yuchi clan.How can I join the ofMonster Slaying Bureau?I think you're the onlyone fit for this title.I won't interfere.You smiled?To be honest,your smile is hideous.Brother Yan, I'll make anhonest report to His Majesty.The scorpion monster died to save people.Yueling Village has been restored.Master Yan made the greatest contribution.Just do as you wish.Brother Yan, are you really staying?My powers are still lacking.I'll wait here for Master Nanwu.I hope that humans andmonsters can live in harmony,and the world has fewer killings.Farewell.Warrior Yan, may we meet again.Brother Ye.Although we can't work inthe imperial court together,we can still hunt monsters togetherand enchant Yueling Village."}

I don't know how it happened But I'll never make such a mistake again Being sorry doesn't help. Anyway, you're not driving again Wherever you go, you will take the driver Is that clear? But I said I'm sorry. And it didn't happen deliberately I promise you, it'll never happen again And sis kept driving around for years.. and nothing ever happened Why do you always compare yourself with your sister? Why you keep comparing with her? Why must you always equate yourself with her? Why do you keep kidding yourself that by changing your looks.. your appearance and your behaviour, you will become another Aarti? Remain what you are. Don't ever try to become Aarti.. because you can never be Aarti You don't have to tell me that I can never be Aarti Everything you have done in the last 3 years, everything.. but never ever told me.. ..has been screaming at me.. ..and telling me that I can never replace Aarti Yes, I can never equate myself with Aarti But in one respect, I can surely step into her shoes.. something you have perhaps forgotten She was lonely.. ..as I am lonely today You didn't have time for her. And you don't have time for me She led her life, always waiting for you And I'm leading my life, too, waiting for you She eventually died, waiting for you.. as I will die one day, waiting for you And like you started realising her worth only after she was dead.. you will perhaps realise my worth after I'm gone Because you do not care for those who live \"She lead her life, always waiting for you\" \"And I'm leading my life, too, waiting for you\" \"She eventually died, waiting for you..\" \"as I will die one day, waiting for you\" \"And like you started realising her worth only after she was dead..\" \"you will perhaps realise my worth after I'm gone\" Anjali hasn't arrived with my luggage yet Actually, we're early sir. You're always so punctual She's angry with me. And rightly too It's my mistake, Harwinder. I never really cared for her But I'm going to make up for the lost time. It's never really too late, is it? - No, sir. When I return from Germany this time.. ..everything else will take a back seat My wife, my kids.. my family will take priority They are going to be my priority. I'll take my family on a long vacation, as soon as I return You organize everything. - Right, sir. And keep everything readt. I'll give my wife this surprise as soon as I return There she is. Hello, ma'am. Let me check in. Sir, your bag. Well.. I have to make a sudden trip to Germany I couldn't come home, because there was very little time So I asked you to pack my bags and bring them to the airport I think I've to rush. Okay. Bye. I'll try and return soon Take care. There he is. Hello, Indian Raja. - Hi. I'm Ravi Sarin and this is Vini Bharti. we're the organisers of your show in Delhi There's a lot of excitement in Delhi over your show of fusion music All tickets sold in advance. We've booked a hotel for your own accommodation and your troupe's.. as well as for your rehearsals. Is that okay with you? Is that fine with you? - That's fine. Thank you. - Would you like to go to the venue or.. You can always call me on my cellphone.. ..if there's anything you need I assure you Indian Raja. Everything will go extremely well. Anjali.. hiding from me? Why're you hiding? What wrong have you done that you can't look me in the eye? Well, at least you now meet my gaze Whom have you come to see off? I see.. you came to see off the one you left me for Wait.. I want to meet you You will meet me, won't you? You will give your old friend a chance, I hope? I wish to forget you once.. forever As you had forgotten me You'll give me the chance, won't you? I'll wait for you You'll come, I hope? You must have very little time for me, isn't it? You expect me to say what I have to as quickly as I can.. so you can show me your back and go back to your love-filled life What right did you have to simply walk out of my life.. without as much as meeting me or giving me an explanation? Now don't tell me you don't have words.. ..to explain what you did was right Even if the world says what you did was right.. even if you claim what you did was right.. was it necessary for you to severe relations with me.. to preserve the ones you had? Whatever anyone has to say, at heart I'll always believe.. that you are unfaithful Yes. I am unfaithful You are right, I am unfaithful But do you know whom I have been most unfaithful to? To my own self What disloyalty have I shown to you.. ..compared to the one I showed myself? In a life full of illusions, loneliness and hollowness.. I have been faithful to everyone else.. I gave happiness to everyone.. as for my own happiness.. I had it snatched away Things aren't as you imagine them to be You can't cast stones at me I'm like the crumbling wall.. ..that is itself looking for support How am I going to lead my life? I have done a great wrong to you. Please forgive me Forgive me.. Forgive me.. \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"I've been your lover for eons\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"I've been your lover for aeons\" \"I've been your lover for aeons\" \"I've been your lover for aeons\" \"Do not stop me from getting closer..\" \"Do not stop me from getting closer..\" \"I've been your lover for ages\" \"I've been your lover for ages\" \"I've been your lover for ages\" \"Love can never be hidden. however hard you try\" \"Don't ever leave me again..\" \"don't ever leave me heartbroken\" \"Don't ever leave me again..\" \"don't ever leave me heartbroken\" \"You have come after much placating..\" \"do not ever make excuses to go missing again\" \"Life ebbs out of me, when you begin to leave..\" \"Life ebbs out of me, when you begin to leave..\" \"I've been your love for ages\" \"I've been your love for ages\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"My love.. O my love..\" \"My love.. O my love..\" \"my love, you do not know..\" \"you are the one my eyes seek everywhere\" \"my love, you do not know..\" \"you are the one my eyes seek everywhere\" \"I live and die, for I see you..\" \"I think of you every moment\" \"I can never forget you, however hard I try\" \"I can never forget you, however hard I try\" \"For I've been your love over the ages\" \"For I've been your love over the ages\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"I've been your lover for aeons\" \"Do not stop me from coming closer..\" \"I've been your lover over the ages\" \"I've been your lover over the ages\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" \"Love can never be hidden, however hard you try\" Stop it. You'll are too much. You guys keep poking fun at someone or the other Anjali.. where have you been? I've been looking for you I kept trying your cell-phone all morning I wanted you to receive me at the airport But you weren't taking any calls. Had you switched off your cell? Well, yes.. How have you been? Look who's here to meet you You're meeting them for the first time I myself ran into them after 3 years This is my closest friend, Dil. (Dil: heart).. Dil Arora Hi, sis-in-law. I'm Dil.. Dil Arora.. here in the city of Delhi, where the large-hearted dwell But I'm not going to call you bhabhi (sister-in-law) What should I call you? Babs. Funny guy. He's a joker. And that's Dil's wife. Pallavi Oh, come on, Adi. Pallavi's such a serious and boring name! Call me Pallu A few of my male friends call me Pallu anyway Naughty girl. I'll spank on your bottom. But I prefer Pallavi. Pallavi and Dil often keep visiting Delhi from Jamshedpur Jamshedpur! It's going to make her think we're farmers. Right, babs? That hurts. Oh no, not at all. Dil Arora's name figures in Forbes' list.. ..of the thousand richest Indians But 999 Indians are still richer than I am That includes your husband Aditya Sahni So what am I doing in your lap, darling? I ought to be in Aditya's lap Bad girl! I'm going to bite you! She's dirty. - Society. This friend of mine from Jamshedpur is getting worse by the day! Babs is getting scandalized, darling. I'm feeling so shy.. - Really? Who could've named her Anjali then? She ought to have been called Bharti (Indian). Anjali, don't take their humour seriously Believe me, their jokes are the life of every party Enough of keeping yourself and your wife lonely, Adi.. Come on, get up. Let's party. Else, Dil Arora will always remain a notch under Aditya Sahni Now tell me, Adi. How did you outdo me and bag the Hanten and Toubro contract? C'mon now.. tell me the secret. - It's no secret, Dil It's my strongest belief. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Hard work always bears fruit No wonder you are my friend, philosopher and guide, Adi For a friend, I could lay down my life If I give away my heart to someone, I give it away for good! Excuse me, darlings. Discuss those boring things, while I freshen up? Anjali, where's the wash room? Come on, show me the world. Oh yes, go and come back hot! Why do women always keep going to the wash-room? Can you tell me why? - Pallavi just told you! She's gone to freshen up. - Freshen up more..? How much more? We're already trapped. How much more are they going to trap us? Hello, Mrs. Shani - Hi! Hello. - Hi. Hello. What happened? By the time I got home yesterday.. Aditya had already arrived What are we going to do now? Simple. Leave everything and come to me Are you mad? Think before you talk.. - I've thought it over I don't want you to face any more tension Come here. We'll get together and find a solution I can't come right now. I'm calling from the nursery I'll drop the kids home and try and find an excuse I will contact you I'll be waiting for you Sure. I'll be there You..? - Yes As usual, right behind you Whom did you say, \"I'll be there\" to? Jappi. - Jappi..? Your hairstylist. Yeah. Surprised to see me here? But if.. Have you noticed? I'm a changed man The one who had left for Germany was another man.. the one who has returned, is someone else Keeping that in mind, a father and a husband.. has come to give his wife and daughters a surprise And sweetheart, the surprises don't end here I've got a huge surprise for you. Guess what? What? - Papa.. Papa.. Gauri and Pooja! Shocked to see Papa here? I've shocked your Mummy too! And now time for surprises. Papa's now going to deliver the big surprise! I've told my secretary that we're going away for 2 and a half months On vacation! Holiday on a world tour. Around the world in 80 days. Happy? And now let's all of us have some lunch. There's going to be a lot of traffic today.. ..because it's the Republic Day That's why I'm taking a train I'll meet you at the Shahdra Station. Nobody will recognise us there \"India - the best in the world\" \"We're its blossoms..\" \"India - the best in the world\" \"India - the best in the world\" \"We're its blossoms..\" \"India - the best in the world\" \"We're its blossoms..\" \"India - the best in the world\" \"We're its blossoms..\" You..?

I had no idea I'm in this metro-rail of Delhi, so are you.. I just don't believe it. Actually.. - Yes, I know, I know We've all been listening to the great strides India is taking.. and the metro-rail is something we've all been talking about You decided to check it out, right? So did I! Even I decided to check it out. \"India - the best in the world\" \"We're its blossoms..\" \"We're its blossoms..\" \"and this is our rosegarden\" \"India - the best in the world\" Adi. Adi. I say! What the hell are you doing here..? What are you the two of you doing here on the sly? Celebrating Independence. What else? - Like us..? I told the wife, let me give you a ride on the metro-rail! You too..? - Great stuff from the Indian government! We're no longer lagging behind any nation in the world What say, babs..? We're going places! When I sat in the metro in London.. I thought we couldn't dream of having it in India But here in Delhi, what a surprise..! Aditya. Forget about the train, they've made such a beautiful station too Oh yes! You've hit the nail on the head. Beautiful station too The train is like the husband; the station is like the wife Hey! What am I seeing..? What on earth am I seeing? \"I see the gentleman hiding..\" \"I see signs of the devastation that is about .. ..to be unleashed on my heart!\" Hey, Adi.. My.. my favourite musician. Fusion master. East meets west. West meets eats. In Raja's voice. Sir! I've kept hearing and hearing your songs over and over again! I can't believe it!

How about having lunch with us? Let's go, if you're free? Maybe another day. Not right now But it's nice meeting you folks So you're making excuses, I see! Never mind, never mind.. I'll catch hold of you another day! No problem! What are you doing at Shahdra Station? - I'm waiting for someone I'm expecting someone.. - Who? C'mon! Why're you bothering him? Let's go.. Oh no.. - C'mon! C'mon! What a singer! What a fantastic singer.. Sorry, my friend is a bit of a nut. But it was nice meeting you Same here. - See you soon. This is unbelievable, Adi! Let me sing a song for you.. \"the train hurtles ahead.. reminding me of my love\" \"the train hurtles ahead.. reminding me of my love\" What are you thinking about? Why're you upset? I'll tell you a way out. Say you can't go on the world tour.. ..because the kids' studies will suffer Yes.. that would be the correct thing to do But how long are we going to continue like this? Until you take a decision I'm telling you even now; leave everything and come to me No.. we must wait for sometime I have no right to ruin other people's lives in a moment.. so as to make my own future I'll go to the office right now and get Aditya to agree to stay back And please leave. It's not right for us to stay here for very long Someone might see us Honey, honey, oh yeah. Hey, Raja. What a surprise. I can't believe we could meet so soon! Don't you recognise me..? But I don't mind! Don't tell me. You must be meeting so many people! Hello! Pallavi Arora.. the metro station? Oh yeah, right. My husband kicked up such a fuss! Any girl would be excited to see you.. she'd go mad, crazy.. but what are you doing here? Well, simply.. - Simply? I'm around \"simply\" too You know, shopping.. as usual. I'm so sorry, you're in a hurry and I'm stopping you What a pile-on I am. See you again, okay? - Okay You will be in Delhi for sometime, won't you? See you again then? Okay, bye. \"Life.. is just happenstance\" \"So it was yesterday.\" Hey! What are you doing here? Obviously, sipping coffee. Right? I believe the coffee here is excellent But why're you all alone? Why're you getting so uncomfortable, Anjali? What happened? How much coffee do you drink, Anjali? From two cups, that is? Excuse me, Anjali. I must leave. - Sure.. go on. By all means I won't reveal your secret to anyone What? That you drink coffee from two cups! Good afternoon, ma'am. Hello, ma'am. What are you doing here in the office, Anjali? Come and sit down Looks like it's a day of surprises. Dil came first and now you.. and you're the one he was talking about.. well, what'll you have? What's this formality between man and wife..? \"What'll you have!\" The speciality of this office is coffee Yummy! I'm sure Babs is going to love the coffee Babs, have some coffee. No, thanks. Take his advise, Anjali When he first says something to me, I never believe it But in time I discover, whatever he says always turns out to be true I've been telling Aditya for the last one hour.. and he just won't understand! He says it's impossible.. and I said, \"Why's it impossible? Let's ask babs herself..\" and before we start looking for you.. ..you walk right in through the door! Now tell me, is there anyone else you're seeing apart from Aditya? I know! I know you're seeing no one! You must either be shopping or sipping coffee. Lonely, all alone! And now that Dil is here all the way from Jamshedpur.. and is still lonely and all alone, what good is that? How can you leave before you get to know me or understand me? Please don't go, babs.. - I don't understand The world tour, babs! Aditya told me you folks are leaving on a world tour The farce hasn't even begun and you're already quitting..? He's beating around the bush to tell us to postpone our world tour.. so as to attend his party. - You must listen to Dil.. and attend Dil's party.. Please! Please! Please, babs! Babs! Say yes! Please! Please,Say yes! Please! Please, babs! Since he's being so insistent, let's stay back till the party But I've put all my work on hold to make time for the vacation It's going to be difficult later. - That's for you to manage The children's studies are also going to suffer.. ..we can always go later Right. You're the boss. We'll do as you say Come on, girls. Come on. Now tell me how I'm looking? - Oh lovely What about my hair. Oh my God! That's the Pop star! Excuse me. Raja.. ? Indian Raja? - Yes Oh my, God. You're so hot. We love you. Love your music. When did you come to Delhi? And what brings you here? Look who is here. Raja, the great fusion singer. Raja, three beauties. Oh, I am sorry. Society queens. Mrs. Anju. - Hi. Mrs. Manju. And Mrs. Sanju. Come, let me introduce you to the others. C'mon.. Dil, why didn't you tell us he was coming to the party? Yes, why not? - What's all the secrecy for? I didn't want you girls to get all hot! Hot. Hot debouched. You've come to my party despite the short notice It was actually my wife's brainwave. She said \"Darling Dil..\" \"our party's going to be attended by millionaires and billionaires..\" \"we have all types of businessmen, but we don't have an artist..\" that's you.. and here you are! How sensitive of you. And I promise you, I'm not going to disappoint you I'll introduce to such people, show you such beautiful faces.. your senses are bound to be numbed. Am I right? Yes. Anjali.. ..isn't he the musician we met at the metro station the other day? I must meet him. Meet Lala, that's his wife Lali, Suresh Bajaj, wife Maninder.. Elder brother Golu. And good old Anju, Manju, Sanju. - Hi. And my best friend, Aditya Sahani. - Hello. Nice to see you again. What's just nice, buddy? It's wonderful, man! Wonderful! I told Raja no one must know he's coming to the party! Surprise. Isn't it amazing..? - Indeed. It is amazing It was at the metro station first, then the restaurant.. and now at our party Some people always seem to be crossing each other's paths Aditya, where's your wife? - Where's Anjali? Where's Mrs. Sahani. She's with my wife. By the way, who are you girls with nowadays? What sort of a question is that? I mean, where are your husbands? China. Not in Bangkok, I hope..? Having a hot, hot massage! They must be visiting India sometimes? What sort of a sick joke is that? I told you, this is one party we mustn't go to! Manju. - Anju - Sanju. Why're you teasing them, Dil? - Stop scolding me, feller.. they're a bunch of shameless women They'll be here at the next party for sure I wasn't teasing them really. I was breathing life into my party! There'll be some scandals, a few hearts will be broken.. only then will it be fun! Why're you getting so tense, Anjali? There's a thin line dividing \"P\" and \"M\" \"Piya\" (beloved), Miyan (husband). Miyan and Piya.. The husband and the lover. What are you trying to say? That which you're trying to hide Sipping coffee from two cups, you can sure fool your husband.. but do you take me for an imbecile too? I could create a scene! Scared, are you..? All right, I won't talk about it I won't tell anyone But there is someone who knows everything Who? It isn't your husband.. it's mine Dil. \"Says the pigeon.. - What?\" \"there's something fishy\" \"Oh.\" \"It flies, carrying word to everyone\" \"Says the pigeon there's something fishy\" \"Says the pigeon there's something fishy\" \"It flies, carrying word to everyone\" \"Love is an amazing test..\" \"Love is an amazing test..\" \"some pass it, some fail\" \"Says the pigeon there's something fishy\" \"It flies, carrying word to everyone\" \"Love is an amazing test..\" \"some pass it, some fail\" \"Husband, lover..\" \"Husband, lover..\" \"I'm so confused, darling\" \"Society's all about confusions of relationships, darling\" \"That's society. High society.\" \"Mind the end of your sari.. it's about to slip\" \"And I'm crazy.. it'll send my heart pounding\" \"The end of my sari, I must mind. It could surely slip..\" \"the crazy hearts would surely skip a beat\" \"Take a look, my love, where's your mind wandering?\" \"Watch your step; there are pitfalls all the way\" \"Every face is masked..\" \"Every face is masked..\" \"they all have their clandestine affairs\" \"Says the pigeon there's something fishy\" \"It flies, carrying word to everyone\" \"They look at something and aim for something else..\" \"why do these lovers take the world for madcaps?\" \"Time will tell, my bird.. - Really?\" \"who's the madcap and who's going to regret it all\" \"One's gain, another's loss\" \"The killer gaze has felled many\" \"One's gain, another's loss\" \"The killer gaze has felled many\" \"Oh these deadly nights.. they set my passions on fire\" \"let's seal our lips. It's a secret after all\" \"It's a cruel world. They fear disgrace..\" \"It's a cruel world. They fear disgrace..\" \"how they suppress their feelings to put up with people!\" \"Says the pigeon..\" \"there's something fishy\" \"Says the pigeon..\" \"there's something fishy\" \"It flies, spreading the word\" \"Love is an amazing test..\" \"Love is an amazing test..\" \"some pass it, some fail\" You guys are the limit! Don't cry And be afraid of no one Neither have you committed a sin, nor have I Don't take Dil and Pallavi's ribbing so seriously If they've got to know what's brewing between us, it's okay But what if they tell Aditya..? - What will happen? That will be good for us. Not at all I'm not prepared yet to tell Aditya about it You were never prepared. You always chose the least difficult path I'll have to take all the decisions now Look at me My show's being staged in two days And that's the night I plan to leave India But not alone. I want to leave with you Make sure you're ready It means, God is the Eternal Truth. Be honest in whatever you do That is the path to inner peace Now repeat after me.. Very good. Mama. Papa. - Anjali. Anjali, how are you, my child? - When did you come..? You didn't even inform us you'd be coming Mom and Papa decided to give us a pleasant surprise They're visiting the Golden Temple in Amritsar.. and will be staying over in Delhi for a day The Golden Temple? Your Papa had sworn a thanksgiving.. that when everything had settled down in the family.. he'd pay a visit to the Golden Temple to pay obeisance's to Guru Nanak And thanks to Nanak, not only is everything okay.. It's just wonderful! Madam, the children still haven't had their milk May I give it to them? Pooja, Gauri.. go and drink your milk No, Mama. We want to be with grandma and grandpa Sweet. - Please. Children, listen to Mama and go and finish your milk I'll give you both a chocolate later Come on, Pooja, Gauri. Go up to your room, have your milk. Come on children. Praise the Lord! God has indeed been very kind to us The crisis we were laden with has at last been resolved Anjali, you've looked after this house so well What we asked you for was no petty thing, my child But you did us all such a huge favour, without any regret whatsoever Aditya was telling us how well you have.. taken care of him, the children and the whole house I am so proud of you, Anjali. You have indeed done commendably well.. ..with the values we imparted to you Parents rarely see how far their children can go.. but some children defy all boundaries and go far beyond them.. and set an example, far outdoing the expectations of their parents.. bringing them so much of glory. As you have set an example now I will pray to God that this family of yours, your house.. may forever be happy May no evil eye ever effect you, may you never face any hardship That's your air-ticket and your companion's too. Both confirmed? At what time will the show begin? - 15 minutes to go for your entry I think you better change. - Yeah, I think you're right. I've only got to wear my costume Excuse me, can I come in please. Yes, of course. Please do come in. Let me get ready then. - Okay. You've got your tickets Vini, Please look after the chief guest. I guessed right. I was thinking right. After your show is over tonight you will go away And I wonder where I'll look for you. - That's hardly how it is Actually there's no point in staying on once my work is over And my work will be over tonight. - Except for one Which one..? - Shake hands What..? - Shake hands, I say.. Don't worry, you won't regret. That's it. I wonder why I always get positive vibes.. ..whenever I shake hands with you That's good. Now please congratulate me. - What for? Come on, congratulate me. It isn't just another beautiful night of your performance.. it's also the wedding anniversary for Anjali and me It's our wedding anniversary. It's three years since we got married You must've noticed there's an age. There's an age gap between Anjali and me Actually, it wasn't even a properly arranged marriage You must've heard how Anjali got married to me, as a commitment.. and made a supreme sacrifice for my family As days are going by, I'm beginning to.. feel more and more love for her Yes, I've heard. She made a very big sacrifice Sorry, I just got talking about my wife.. I had actually come backstage to wish you all the best I am sure you're going to have a beautiful performance. Good luck. - Thank you. Let me see you to the door.. - No, no, please! Your fans are going to mob you out there I'll find my way Good luck my friend. You, Anjali..? Aditya was here moments ago. He didn't see you, did he? He was saying a lot of strange things to me He didn't seem to be saying what he had on his mind I don't know what was wrong with him? He hasn't got to know, has he? Even if he's got to know, we care a damn! Big deal! Look, even if it comes out in the open.. tell him straightaway that you're going to spend your life with Raja I've even got two tickets to Montreal.. we'll go back to our world. We'll forget about everything Including our values? What do you mean? I'm talking about the values I have imbibed from my parents When I reached home the other day, I met Mama and Papa there They were going to the Golden Temple.. to pray for a happy married life for me Seeing me at home was a dream come true for them I was Anjali, and yet they looked at me as if I were Aarti But I'm not Aarti.. ..I'm Anjali And I couldn't look them in the eye Those who cannot look their parents in the eye.. are surely doing something wrong So I won't be able to do it, Raja. I'm not going Wonderful! Whenever my life is about to settle down.. you are reminded of your duties towards the world Raja is heart-broken. His house is blown asunder.. he stands isolated Because you always kept him out of your life Aarti only had to die.. for you to go about making people's lives Couldn't you spot me anywhere? Once earlier, you had walked out of my life And now, you're walking out again Do not ruin me anymore Whatever you say, I'm not changing the path I have chosen And Raja has decided his path too I'm taking you away Either you come of your own volition, or I'll have to create a scene Don't force me, please It would be better if we end this here and now Even creating a scene will end it once and for all I'm leaving In that case, I too will ruin your happy family before I leave I leave that to you, Raja Whether you call me loyal for the decision I've taken.. or even unfaithful \"Do not view the thorns with such contempt..\" \"they're useful too\" \"Have not love for roses alone\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" \"My love for you is indeed a curse..\" \"My love for you is indeed a curse..\" \"for you are unfaithful, you are faithless\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"for you are unfaithful, you are faithless\" \"A glass wrecked..\" \"causes a shrill noise\" \"The cries of a broken heart..\" \"no one listens to\" \"I'm crazy, mad, obsessed..\" \"in her memories, I live. In my love for her, I die\" \"The state of my heart, she will never realise..\" \"a million times I reason with her.. ..but she's still not going to listen\" \"How wicked are her charms..\" \"How wicked are her charms..\" \"she's treacherous, a betrayer\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" \"May she never sleep..\" \"may she awake all nights\" \"For someone's love..\" \"may she pine forever\" \"She has tormented me, I will torment her too\" \"In this gathering today, I'm going to disgrace her\" \"There's a fire on my breath, a restlessness in my heart..\" \"she sits with her head bowed, in another man's arms\" \"The one whose charms I'm drunk on..\" \"is a betrayer, a faithless one\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" \"Oh, what a curse love has been..\" \"Oh, what a curse love has been..\" \"you are disloyal, you are unfaithful\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is an unfaithful woman, she is faithless\" What..? Raja.. what the hell are you doing?! No. No. Stop it, I say! You don't know what they were upto! They were.. I know everything I've known everything right from the beginning I'm the one who told them If you have any questions, you can ask me You couldn't forget your first love, even after our marriage You were justified too. You just weren't mature enough But I should've been wiser, and yet I made a mistake And by the time I could realise it, things had totally changed It was too late by the time I saw the writing on the wall You had already walked out.. ..of my life I then started thinking how I could bring you back Had I even reasoned with you then.. maybe you wouldn't have been able to understand I wondered how I could bring you back to my house, to my family.. and it was there that my friends came to my help They're not enemies; they, in fact, have shared my secret Sister-in-law.. ..I won't call you \"babs\" today For whatever mistakes we might have made.. please forgive us We had no other way of saving your family Anjali.. ..there is no need for you to feel ashamed You have done no wrong. Nor have I ever considered you guilty If I have done whatever I did it was only to make you aware.. as to the path you wanted to choose for yourself Even when you married me.. you might perhaps have taken a wrong step, in a fit of emotions But today, you can think only about yourself You can think with a calm mind and decide for yourself I will accept it. You need not worry about me As for the children.. they'll start understanding too I will stand by you in any decision you take What are you thinking about? What is there to think about anymore? We were either wrong to have met secretly, or we were right Must we think about all that at this stage? Now that everybody has got to know the truth.. I have no hesitation in saying that I love you very dearly And I've loved you since the days they weren't even part of your life It's just our misfortune that.. ..your sister is no longer with us She wanted us both to get married too.. but our destiny let us down And now that destiny has given us another chance.. must you still keep thinking? Do you want to know what I'm thinking about I think.. ..a wife can be unfaithful.. a girl, a lover, can also be unfaithful But a mother can never be unfaithful A mother can never be unfaithful with her children So how can I abandon these children.. ..whose mother has already left them? How may I snatch their mother from them all over again..? And the truth is that.. ..they were never Aarti's children.. they were always Anjali's children. My children Mama.. Mama.. Mama.. Mama.. Mama.. Mama.. Where had you gone away, Mama? - Where, Mama? Nowhere, my children.. ..I'd never leave my children and go anywhere I will never leave you and go away. Never ever.. okay? I love you. Papa, why's Mama crying? - Why's she in tears? It's because she loves you very much Raja.. ..are you going away? Yes. Yes. Going away from here would be the path for me The path Anjali had chosen earlier, was the right one And the path she has chosen today, is the right one too Raja.. we gave you a lot of trouble, didn't we? Please forgive us, my friend. We aren't so bad after all You are the best friends one can hope to have With friends like you, destiny would never let anyone down \"Difficult is the path of love..\" \"it's only after you're trudged far and wide that you find your goal\" \"Difficult is the path of love..\" \"it's only after you're trudged far and wide that you find your goal\" \"Heed your heart, keep loving..\" \"lead your life as your heart asks you to\" \"I know, Love is God..\" \"I know, Love is God..\" \"it's different from everything else\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"The one I've lost my heart to..\" \"is different from everyone else\" Where are the children? They've already checked in with Pallavi They were quite a handful They're really excited about this world tour. And that gives us husband and wife some moments of privacy We have also decided that.. ..when we return this time, we'll be a threesome I've told Pallavi to learn how to handle kids, bring them up Enough of fun and teasing, I say. Let's start a family now! Right? Raja, why're you staring at me like that? Forgive me, I say! In any case, I'm like a fly in your presence.. a swat and it'll be good-bye! Adieu! We must leave now, Raja We've to check-in for our flight. It's famous at the Delhi airport anyway.. that Aditya Sahni always turns up at the last call I want to check-in on time today and give everyone a shock Shall we, Dil..? - Sure Hi. - Hello. You've a companion ticket sir. Your companion? - No. No companion. On the contrary, I want cancel my companion ticket. Can you do that for me, please. - Sure. Is this the immigration form? - Yes. - Thank you. Everyone falls in love. So did I You folks must've fallen in love, too It's said that man can never forget his first love But it's quite an outdated thing. We must quietly accept whatever God decides for us Because we should not argue with him. Because God knows best.. and He's not our enemy, He's our friend He will surely find you someone who will love you beyond all limits She will come, she surely will. For you, for me.. I am waiting for her. So best of luck to all of you.. And please wish me all the best. Your ticket, sir. And boarding pass. - Right on time.
